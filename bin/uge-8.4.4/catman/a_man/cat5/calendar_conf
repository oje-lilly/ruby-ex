       calendar_conf - Univa Grid Engine calendar configuration file format

       _c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r___c_o_n_f  reflects  the  format  of the Univa Grid Engine calendar
       configuration. The definition of calendars is used to specify "on duty"
       and  "off  duty" time periods for Univa Grid Engine queues on a time of
       day, day of week or day of year basis. Various calendars can be  imple-
       mented  and  the appropriate calendar definition for a certain class of
       jobs can be attached to a queue.

       _c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r___c_o_n_f entries can be added, modified  and  displayed  with  the
       _-_A_c_a_l,  _-_a_c_a_l,  _-_M_c_a_l,  _-_m_c_a_l,  _-_s_c_a_l and _-_s_c_a_l_l options to _q_c_o_n_f(1) or
       with the calendar configuration dialog of the graphical user  interface
       _q_m_o_n(1).

       Note,  Univa  Grid Engine allows backslashes (\) be used to escape new-
       line (\newline) characters. The backslash and the newline are  replaced
       with a space (" ") character before any interpretation.

FFOORRMMAATT
   ccaalleennddaarr__nnaammee
       The name of the calendar to be used when attaching it to queues or when
       administering   the   calendar   definition.   See   _c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r___n_a_m_e   in
       _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1) for a precise definition of valid calendar names.

   yyeeaarr
       The queue status definition on a day of the year basis. This field gen-
       erally will specify on which days of a year (and  optionally  at  which
       times  on  those days) a queue, to which the calendar is attached, will
       change to a certain state. The syntax of the yyeeaarr field is  defined  as
       follows:

       yyeeaarr:=
           { NONE
           | yyeeaarr__ddaayy__rraannggee__lliisstt==ddaayyttiimmee__rraannggee__lliisstt[==ssttaattee]

           | state}

       Where

       +o  NONE means, no definition is made on the year basis

       +o  if  a  definition  is  made  on  the  year  basis,  at  least one of
          yyeeaarr__ddaayy__rraannggee__lliisstt, ddaayyttiimmee__rraannggee__lliisstt and ssttaattee always have to  be
          present,

       +o  all day long is assumed if ddaayyttiimmee__rraannggee__lliisstt is omitted,

       +o  switching the queue to "off" (i.e. disabling it) is assumed if ssttaattee
          is omitted,

       +o  the queue is assumed to  be  enabled  for  days  neither  referenced
          implicitly (by omitting the yyeeaarr__ddaayy__rraannggee__lliisstt) nor explicitly

       and the syntactical components are defined as follows:

         yyeeaarr__ddaayy__rraannggee__lliisstt := {yyeeaarrddaayy-yyeeaarrddaayy|yyeeaarrddaayy},...

         yyeeaarr :=      {1970|1971|...|2037}

   wweeeekk
       The queue status definition on a day of the week basis. This field gen-
       erally will specify on which days of a week (and  optionally  at  which
       times  on  those days) a queue, to which the calendar is attached, will
       change to a certain state. The syntax of the wweeeekk field is  defined  as
       follows:

       wweeeekk:=
           { NONE
           | wweeeekk__ddaayy__rraannggee__lliisstt[==ddaayyttiimmee__rraannggee__lliisstt][==ssttaattee]

       Where

       +o  NONE means, no definition is made on the week basis

       +o  if  a  definition  is  made  on  the  week  basis,  at  least one of
          wweeeekk__ddaayy__rraannggee__lliisstt, ddaayyttiimmee__rraannggee__lliisstt and ssttaattee always have to  be
          present,

       +o  every day in the week is assumed if wweeeekk__ddaayy__rraannggee__lliisstt is omitted,

       +o  syntax  and  semantics of ddaayyttiimmee__rraannggee__lliisstt and ssttaattee are identical
          to the definition given for the year field above,

       +o  the queue is assumed to  be  enabled  for  days  neither  referenced
          implicitly (by omitting the wweeeekk__ddaayy__rraannggee__lliisstt) nor explicitly

       and where wweeeekk__ddaayy__rraannggee__lliisstt is defined as

         wweeeekk__ddaayy__rraannggee__lliisstt := {wweeeekkddaayy-wweeeekkddaayy|wweeeekkddaayy},...
         wweeeekk__ddaayy :=  {mon|tue|wed|thu|fri|sat|sun}

       with week_day ranges the week_day identifiers must be different.

SSEEMMAANNTTIICCSS
       Successive  entries  to  the yyeeaarr and wweeeekk fields (separated by blanks)
       are combined in compliance with the following rule:

       +o  "off"-areas  are  overridden  by   overlapping   "on"-   and   "sus-
          pended"-areas and "suspended"-areas are overridden by "on"-areas.

       Hence an entry of the form

         week  12-18 tue=13-17=on

       means  that  queues referencing the corresponding calendar are disabled
       the entire week from 12.00-18.00 with the exception of Tuesday  between
       13.00-17.00 where the queues are available.


       +o  Area  overriding  occurs  only  within  a year/week basis. If a year
          entry exists for a day then only the year  calendar  is  taken  into
          account  and  no area overriding is done with a possibly conflicting
          week area.


       +o  the second time specification in a daytime_range_list may be  before
          the first one and treated as expected. Thus an entry of the form

            year  12.03.2004=12-11=off

          causes  the queue(s) be disabled 12.03.2004 from 00:00:00 - 10:59:59
          and 12:00:00 - 23:59:59.

       (The   following   examples   are   contained    in    the    directory
       $SGE_ROOT/util/resources/calendars).

       +o  Night, weekend and public holiday calendar:

          On public holidays "night" queues are explicitly enabled. On working
          days queues are disabled between 6.00 and 20.00. Saturday and Sunday
          are implicitly handled as enabled times:

            week           mon-fri=6-20


       +o  Day calendar:

          On  public  holidays "day"-queues are disabled. On working days such
          queues are closed during the night between 20.00 and 6.00, i.e.  the
          queues  are  also  closed  on Monday from 0.00 to 6.00 and on Friday
          from 20.00 to 24.00. On Saturday and Sunday the queues are disabled.

       +o  Night, weekend and public holiday calendar with suspension:

          Essentially  the  same  scenario as the first example but queues are
          suspended instead of switching them "off".

            week           mon-fri=6-20=suspended


       +o  Day calendar with suspension:

          Essentially the same scenario as the second example but  queues  are
          suspended instead of switching them "off".

            calendar_name  day_s

            week           mon-fri=20-6=suspended sat-sun=suspended


       +o  Weekend calendar with suspension, ignoring public holidays:

          Settings  are  only  done on the week basis, no settings on the year
          basis (keyword "NONE").
