       share_tree - Univa Grid Engine share tree file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The   share   tree  defines  the  long-term  resource  entitlements  of
       users/projects and of a hierarchy of arbitrary groups thereof.

       The current share tree  can  be  displayed  via  the  _q_c_o_n_f(1)  --ssssttrreeee
       option.  The  output follows the _s_h_a_r_e___t_r_e_e format description. A share
       tree can be created and an existing one can be modified via the --aassttrreeee
       and  --mmssttrreeee  options  to  _q_c_o_n_f(1).  The --sssstt option shows a formatted
       share tree (tree view).  Individual share tree nodes  can  be  created,
       modified,  deleted,  or shown via the --aassttnnooddee, --ddssttnnooddee, --mmssttnnooddee, and
       --ssssttnnooddee options to _q_c_o_n_f(1).

       Note, Univa Grid Engine allows backslashes (\) be used to  escape  new-
       line  (\newline) characters. The backslash and the newline are replaced
       with a space (" ") character before any interpretation.

       A tree is constructed from a root node, internal nodes and leaf  nodes.
       The  simplest useful tree consists of the root node and two leaf nodes.
       Internal nodes can be used to group leaf nodes.  These  internal  nodes
       can  either be abstract nodes with no relation to any Univa Grid Engine
       object, or nodes of type project, which relate to a defined Univa  Grid
       Engine  project  (see  _p_r_o_j_e_c_t(5)).  _u_s_e_r(5)) or type project. See also
       the explanations in FORMAT and the EXAMPLES below.

FFOORRMMAATT
       The format of a share tree file is defined as follows:

       +o  A new node starts with the attribute iidd,  and  equal  sign  and  the
          numeric  identification  number  of  the node. Further attributes of
          that node follow until another iidd-keyword is encountered.

       +o  The attribute ttyyppee defines, if a sharetree node  references  a  user
          (type=0), or a project (type=1)

       +o  The  attribute  cchhiillddnnooddeess  contains a comma separated list of child
          nodes to this node.

       +o  The parameter nnaammee refers to an arbitrary name for the node or to  a
          corresponding  user (see _u_s_e_r(5)) or project (see _p_r_o_j_e_c_t(5)) if the
          node is a leaf node of the share tree. The name for the root node of
          the tree is "Root" by convention.

       +o  The  parameter  sshhaarreess defines the share of the node among the nodes
          with the same parent node.

       +o  A user leaf node named 'default' can be defined as a descendant of a
          _p_r_o_j_e_c_t(5))  node  in  the  share tree. The default node defines the
          number of shares for users  who are running in the project, but  who
          do  not have a user node defined under the project. The default user
          node is a convenient way of specifying a single node for  all  users
          which  should  receive  an equal share of the project resources. The
          default node may be specified by itself or with other _u_s_e_r(5)) nodes
          at  the  same  level  below a project. All users, whether explicitly
          specified as a user node or those which map to  the  'default'  user
          node  must  have a corresponding _u_s_e_r(5)) object defined in order to
          get shares. Do not configure a _u_s_e_r(5)) object named 'default'.
