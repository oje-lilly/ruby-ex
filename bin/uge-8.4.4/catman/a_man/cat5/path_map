       path_map - Univa Grid Engine path mapping file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The _p_a_t_h___m_a_p file is only necessary if a Windows (win-x86) host is part
       of the Univa Grid Engine cluster. It is used to define how  UNIX  paths
       shall be converted into Windows paths.

       The  _p_a_t_h___m_a_p  file contains a list of comma separated mappings between
       UNIX and the corresponding Windows paths.  There  are  two  columns  in
       each  line.  In  the left column, the UNIX path is listed, in the right
       column, the corresponding Windows path is listed. The columns are sepa-
       rated by a comma, which may be followed by a blank to improve readabil-
       ity.

       The _p_a_t_h___m_a_p file will be used only on Windows and by these Univa  Grid
       Engine components: _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8), _s_g_e___s_h_e_p_h_e_r_d(8), _u_g_e___j_s___s_e_r_v_i_c_e_._e_x_e(8)
       and all Univa Grid Engine client commands.

       If these Univa Grid Engine components have to convert a path, they will
       scan the left column of the _p_a_t_h___m_a_p file from top to bottom until they
       find a path that matches the beginning of the path  to  convert.   This
       part will then be replaced by the Windows path from the right column of
       the same line. After this, all slashes in the path to convert  will  be
       replaced  by  backslashes.   Because of this, it is not possible to use
       UNIX paths that contain backslashes for a  Univa  Grid  Engine  cluster
       that includes a Windows host.

       A  proper  _p_a_t_h___m_a_p file always contains a mapping with the pseudo path
       "/execd_spool_dir/win-x86/placeholder" in the  left  column.  The  same
       path  appears  in  the configuration of a Windows execution host. It is
       just a placeholder that is necessary because it's not possible to  con-
       figure Windows paths in the global or execution host configuration.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEE
       If  the  path  to  convert is "/home/jdoe/joboutputs/myjob.o17" and the
       path_map file looks like this:

       /opt/UGE820, \\server\share\UGE820
       /execd_spool_dir/win-x86/placeholder, c:\tmp\spool\UGE
       /var/sgeCA, c:\tmp\var\sgeCA
       /home, \\homeserver\homeshare
       /tmp, c:\tmp

       then Univa Grid Engine will scan over the lines in  the  _p_a_t_h___m_a_p  file
       until  it finds in the left column a path that matches the beginning of
       the path to convert. In this case, this is the path "/home". It will be
       replaced  in  the  path  to convert by the content of the right column,
       resulting in the intermediate path "\\homeserver\homeshare/jdoe/jobout-
       puts/myjob.o17".  Then,  all  slashes in the path are replaced by back-
       slashes,   resulting   in   the    final    path    "\\homeserver\home-
       share\jdoe\joboutputs\myjob.o17".
