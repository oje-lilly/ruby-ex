DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _Q_r_s_u_b  provides  a means for operators, managers or users referenced in
       the ACL (see _a_c_c_e_s_s___l_i_s_t(5)) "aarruusseerrss" to create a Advance  Reservation
       (AR) in the Univa Grid Engine queuing system. ARs allow to reserve par-
       ticular consumable resources for future use. These  reserved  resources
       are only available for jobs requesting the AR and the scheduler ensures
       the availability of the resources when the start time is  reached.  Job
       requesting the AR can only use the reserved consumable resources.

       During  AR submit time the Univa Grid Engine queuing system selects the
       best suited queues for the AR request and  then  reserves  the  desired
       amount  of  resources.   For  a reservation, all queues that are not in
       orphaned state are considered as suited. Only if the AR request can  be
       fulfilled, the AR will be granted.

       ARs  will be deleted either automatically when the end time is reached,
       or manually using _q_r_d_e_l _.  In both cases, first all jobs requesting the
       AR will be removed and then AR itself. Already granted ARs can be shown
       with _q_r_s_t_a_t(.)

       Note: To make AR behavior predictable, it is necessary to have reserved
       resources  available  at  the time of AR start. This is done by keeping
       jobs with a unlimited runtime limit separated from ARs, and not consid-
       ering resources used by such jobs for reservation.

       Note: Resource Quotas are not considered for AR queue selection and nor
       for jobs requesting a AR.

       When an AR was successfully added to the Univa Grid Engine queuing sys-
       tem  _q_r_s_u_b  returns a unique integer ID referring the the newly created
       AR. The highest AR ID is 9999999. If  the  highest  ID  is  reached,  a
       wraparound  happens  and  the  next unused ID, starting with 1, will be
       used.

       For _q_r_s_u_b, the administrator and the user may  define  default  request
       files (analogous to Univa Grid Engine_request for qsub), which can con-
       tain any of the possible command line options.
       A cluster wide default request file is optional.   If  such  a  default
       request file is used, it must be placed under
       $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sge_ar_request (global defaults file).
       A user private default request file is optional. If it is used, it must
       be placed under
       $HOME/.sge_ar_request (user private defaults file).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --aa ddaattee__ttiimmee
              Defines the activation (start) date and  time  of  an  AR.   The
              option  is  not  mandatory. If omitted, the current date_time is
              assumed. Either a duration or end date_time must also be  speci-
              fied. For details about date_time please see _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1)

       --AA aaccccoouunntt__ssttrriinngg
              Identifies  the account to which the resource reservation of the
              AR should be charged. For "aaccccoouunntt__ssttrriinngg" value details  please
              see  the  "nnaammee"  definition in _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1).  In the absence of
              this parameter Univa Grid Engine will place the default  account
              string "sge" in the accounting record of the AR.

       --cckkpptt cckkpptt__nnaammee
              Selects the checkpointing environment (see _c_h_e_c_k_p_o_i_n_t(5)) the AR
              jobs may request. Using this option guarantees queues that  only
              providing this checkpoint environment will be reserved.

       --dd ttiimmee
              Defines the duration of the AR. The use of "--dd ttiimmee" is optional
              if "--ee ddaattee__ttiimmee" is requested.  For details about  "ttiimmee" defi-
              nition please see _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1).

       --ee ddaattee__ttiimmee
              Defines  the  end  date  and  time  of  an  AR.  The  use of "--ee
              ddaattee__ttiimmee" is optional if "--dd ttiimmee" is requested.   For  details
              about "ddaattee__ttiimmee" definition please see _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1).

       --ffrr yy[[eess]]||nn[[oo]]
              Specifies  the behaviour of the AR at AR start time.  With ("--ffrr
              yyeess") jobs still blocking resources being granted to the AR will
              be  killed.   With  default  behaviour  ("--ffrr  nnoo") jobs holding
              resources being granted to the AR can continue running  and  may
              prevent  start of jobs in the AR.  In the current implementation
              only resources requested by the AR via exclusive  complexes  are
              freed.   The feature is suited for freeing whole queue instances
              or hosts or even the whole cluster, e.g.  for  maintenance  pur-
              poses.  Requesting "--ffrr yyeess" requires operator rights.

       --hhee yy[[eess]]||nn[[oo]]
              Specifies the behavior when the AR goes into an error state. The
              AR goes into error state when a reserved host goes into  unknown
              state,  a  queue  error  happens, or when a queue is disabled or
              suspended.

              A hard error, "--hhee yyeess", means as long as the  AR  is  in  error
              state  no  jobs  using the AR will be scheduled.  If soft error,
              "--hhee nnoo", is specified the AR stays usable  with  the  remaining
              resources.
              By default soft error handling is used.


       --hheellpp  Prints a list of all options.

       --ll rreessoouurrccee==vvaalluuee,...
              Creates  an AR in a Univa Grid Engine queue, providing the given
              resource request list.   _c_o_m_p_l_e_x(5)  describes  how  a  list  of
              available  resources and their associated valid value specifiers
              can be obtained.
              There may be multiple --ll switches in a single command.

       --mm bb||ee||aa||nn
              Defines or redefines under which circumstances  mail  is  to  be
              sent  to the AR owner or to the users defined with the --MM option
              described below. The option arguments have the  following  mean-
              ing:

              `b'     Mail is sent at the beginning of the AR
              `e'     Mail is sent at the end of the AR
              `a'     Mail is sent when the AR goes into error state
              `n'     No mail is sent, default for _q_r_s_u_b

       --MM uusseerr[[@@hhoosstt]],,......
              Defines  or  redefines  the  list  of users to which the qmaster
              sends mail.

       --mmaasstteerrqq wwcc__qquueeuuee__lliisstt
              Only meaningful for a parallel AR request together with the  -pe
              option.

              This  option  is used to reserve the proper queues to match this
              request if it would be requested by a  qsub.   A  more  detailed
              description of _w_c___q_u_e_u_e___l_i_s_t can be found in _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1).

       --nnooww yy[[eess]]||nn[[oo]]
              This options impacts the queues selection for reservation.
              With  the  "--nnooww yy" option, only queues with the qtype "INTERAC-
              TIVE" assigned will be considered for reservation.  "--nnooww nn"  is
              the default for _q_r_s_u_b.

       --NN nnaammee
              The  name  of  the  AR.  The name, if requested, must conform to
              "nnaammee" as defined in _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1).  Invalid names will be denied
              at submit time.

       --PP pprroojjeecctt__nnaammee
              This  option  binds  the  AR  to a project. Only members of this
              project are allowed to use this AR.

       --ww ee||vv Specifies the validation level applied to the AR request.

              The specifiers e and v define the following validation modes:

              `v'  verify - does not submit the AR but prints
                   an extensive validation report
              `e'  error - rejects request if requirements cannot
                   be fulfilled, default for _q_r_s_u_b

       --ppee ppaarraalllleell__eennvv nn[[--[[mm]]]]||[[--]]mm,,......
              Parallel programming environment (PE) to select for the AR queue
              reservation.  Please see the details of a PE in _s_g_e___p_e(5).

       --qq wwcc__qquueeuuee__lliisstt
              Defines  or redefines a list of cluster queues, queue domains or
              queue instances, that may be reserved by the AR. Please  find  a
              description  of  _w_c___q_u_e_u_e___l_i_s_t  in _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1).  This parameter
              has all the properties of a resource request and will be  merged
              with requirements derived from the --ll option described above.

       --rraaoo yy[[eess]]||nn[[oo]]
              Specifies  which resources will be considered for the AR at sub-
              mission / reservation time.  With --rraaoo yyeess only currently avail-
              able  resources  will  be reserved, this means only queues which
              are not in disabled, suspended or error state.  Default  setting
              for  --rraaoo  is  "no".   A cluster wide setting for only reserving
              available   resources   can   be    done    via    qmaster_param
              AR_RESERVE_AVAILABLE_ONLY, see also _s_g_e___c_o_n_f(5).

       --ssii sseessssiioonn__iidd
              Requests  sent  by this client to the _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(1) daemon will
              be done as part of the specified session. If the switch is omit-
              ted  or  if  NNOONNEE  is specified as sseessssiioonn__iidd then such requests
              will be executed outside the control of a session.

              Find more information concerning sessions in _s_e_s_s_i_o_n___c_o_n_f(5).

       --uu [[uusseerrnnaammee||@@aacccceessss__lliisstt]],,......
              Defines the users allowed to submit jobs requesting the AR.  The
              access  is  specified  by a comma separated list containing UNIX
              users or ACLs (see _a_c_c_e_s_s___l_i_s_t(5)).  prefixing the ACL name with
              an '@' sign.
              By  default only the AR owner is allowed to submit jobs request-
              ing the AR.

              Note: Only queues, where all users specified in  the  list  have
              access, are considered for reservation (see _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5)).

       SSGGEE__RROOOOTT       Specifies the location of the Univa Grid Engine standard
                      configuration files.

       SSGGEE__CCEELLLL       If set, specifies the default Univa Grid Engine cell. To
                      address  a  Univa Grid Engine cell, _q_s_u_b, _q_s_h, _q_l_o_g_i_n or
                      _q_a_l_t_e_r use (in the order of precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. ddeeffaauulltt.

       SSGGEE__DDEEBBUUGG__LLEEVVEELL
                      If set, specifies that debug information should be writ-
                      ten to stderr. In addition the level of detail in  which
                      debug information is generated is defined.

       SSGGEE__QQMMAASSTTEERR__PPOORRTT
                      If  set,  specifies the TCP port on which _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8)
                      is expected to listen for communication requests.   Most
                      installations will use a services map entry for the ser-
                      vice "sge_qmaster" instead of defining the port.
