       _s_g_e_p_a_s_s_w_d modifies the Univa Grid Engine password file _s_g_e_p_a_s_s_w_d(5).

       This  file  contains  a list of usernames and their windows password in
       encrypted form.  _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8)  and  _s_g_e___s_h_e_p_h_e_r_d(8)  on  hosts  running
       Microsoft  Windows  as  operating systems use this information to start
       jobs for a certain user.

       Each user can use the _s_g_e_p_a_s_s_w_d application to add a new entry for  the
       own  user  account.  It  is also possible to change the stored password
       with _s_g_e_p_a_s_s_w_d as far as the user knows the old one.

       The root user additionally has the permission to  change  the  password
       entries for other user accounts. Root can also delete existing entries.

       The _s_g_e_p_a_s_s_w_d application is only available on  non-Windows  hosts.  In
       order  to be able to modify the _s_g_e_p_a_s_s_w_d(5) file, the _s_g_e_p_a_s_s_w_d appli-
       cation needs to run with the right user ID  set  (usually  the  one  of
       root).  To  achieve this, the setuid bit has to be set in the file per-
       missions and the _s_g_e_p_a_s_s_w_d application has to be  owned  by  the  right
       user  (usually  root).  The _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8) installation script sets the
       permissions and owner properly if it is requested.

       The "ls -l" output of the _s_g_e_p_a_s_s_w_d application should look like this:

       -r-sr-xr-x  1 root root 4136176 Dec 10 15:51 sgepasswd

       However, the setuid mechanism does not work if the  _s_g_e_p_a_s_s_w_d  applica-
       tion resides on a file system that is mounted with the "nosuid" option.
       If policies require the $SGE_ROOT directory to be  located  on  such  a
       file  system, copying the _s_g_e_p_a_s_s_w_d application to a different location
       is a possible workaround for this problem.

              Per default _s_g_e_p_a_s_s_w_d will add/modify the current Unix  username
              without  domain specification.  This switch can be used to add a
              domain specification in front of the current user name.  Consult
              your  Microsoft  Windows  documentation  to get more information
              about domain users.
