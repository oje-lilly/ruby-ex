       _Q_m_o_d  enabled users classified as owners of a running job, queue or job
       class to modify the state of that object. Users that have  submitted  a
       job automatically own the job. Queue and job class ownership is defined
       by the _o_w_n_e_r attribute within a queue and by the  _o_w_n_e_r___l_i_s_t  attribute
       defined  in  the  job  class (see _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5) or _s_g_e___j_o_b___c_l_a_s_s(5) for
       details).

       A manager/operator or root can execute _q_m_o_d for any object in  a  Univa
       Grid Engine but only from administrative hosts.

       The  switches  below expect the arguments _w_c___q_u_e_u_e___l_i_s_t, _w_c___j_o_b___l_i_s_t or
       _j_c___l_i_s_t that describe the object that  should  be  modified.  Find  the
       description for these arguments in _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1).

              the --ccjj or --ccqq switch instead.

              Clears the error state of the specified jobs(s)/queue(s).

       --ccjj wwcc__jjoobb__rraannggee__lliisstt
              Clears the error state of the specified jobs(s).

       --ccqq wwcc__qquueeuuee__lliisstt
              Clears the error state of the specified queue(s).

       --dd wwcc__qquueeuuee__lliisstt
              Disables the queue(s), i.e. no further jobs  are  dispatched  to
              disabled queues while jobs already executing in these queues are
              allowed to finish.

       --ddjjcc jjcc__lliisstt
              Disables the job class variant(s) that are  specified.  If  only
              the job class name is specified (without variant name) then only
              the default variant of a job class will be disabled whereas  all
              other  variants  remain in their previous state. Job class vari-
              ants that are in the disabled state cannot be used to create new
              jobs.

       --ee wwcc__qquueeuuee__lliisstt
              Enables the queue(s).

       --EE wwcc__qquueeuuee__lliisstt
              Sets queue(s) into error state.

       --eejjcc jjcc__lliisstt
              Enables  the  job  class variant(s) that are specified.  If only
              the job class name is specified (without variant name) then only
              the  default variant of a job class will be disabled whereas all
              other variants remain in their previous state. Job  class  vari-
              ants that are in enabled state can be used to create new jobs.

       --ff     Force the modification action for the queue despite the apparent
              current state of the queue. For example if a queue appears to be
              suspended  but the job execution seems to be continuing the man-
              ager/operator can force a suspend operation which  will  send  a
              SIGSTOP  to  the jobs. In any case, the queue or job status will
              be set even if the _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8) controlling the queues/jobs can-
              not be reached. Requires manager/operator privileges.

       --hheellpp  Prints a listing of all options.

       --mmssgg [[mmeessssaaggee]]
              The  --mmssgg  switch can be used in combination with other switches
              of this command that trigger queue state changes. The  specified
              message  will  be  attached  to  specified queues. If message is
              omitted then previously attached messages will be  deleted.  The
              message  string  will  be  displayed  by qstat if the --eexxppllaaiinn mm
              switch is specified for this command.

       --pp jjiidd wwcc__jjoobb__ttaasskk__lliisstt [[pprreeeemmppttiivvee__aaccttiioonn]]
              Sends a manual preemption request to the Univa Grid Engine  sys-
              tem.

              The  job  specified by _j_i_d has to be pending and it will be seen
              as preemptor candidate by the  Univa  Grid  Engine  system.  All
              other   jobs   (or   tasks   of   an  array  job)  specified  by
              _w_c___j_o_b___t_a_s_k___l_i_s_t have to be running and they  act  as  preemptee
              candidates.

              The  Univa  Grid  Engine  scheduler tries to start the preemptor
              candidate if there are no other jobs  with  a  higher  effective
              priority. If there are no free resources available then the sys-
              tem will preempt the preemptee candidates to gain access to  the
              used resources so that the preemptor candidate can be started.

              The  method how preemptee candidates are preempted can be speci-
              fied by the _p_r_e_e_m_p_t_i_o_n___a_c_t_i_o_n. It can  be  one  of  the  letters
              (SS)suspend, e(NN)handed suspend, (PP)reempt, (CC)heckpoint, (RR)erun
              or (TT)erminate. If the specified preemption action is not avail-
              able  for a preemptee candidate or when the _p_r_e_e_m_p_t_i_o_n___a_c_t_i_o_n is
              not specified then the system might choose an  appropriate  pre-
              emption action to gain required resources.

              For more detail about preemption and the differences of the pre-
              emptive actions read _s_g_e___p_r_e_e_m_p_t_i_o_n(5)

              Requires  root  or  manager privileges. In order for a job to be
              rescheduled, it or the queue in which it is executing must  have
              the rerun flag activated. (See _-_r option in the _q_s_u_b(1) man page

              If  applied to queues, reschedules all jobs currently running in

              the  master  task of this parallel job is running in this queue.

       --ssjj wwcc__jjoobb__rraannggee__lliisstt
              If applied to running jobs,  suspends  the  jobs.  For  parallel
              jobs, Univa Grid Engine sends the STOP signal to the master task
              only. The master task has to handle the suspending of all  slave
              tasks  itself  then.  This  is because Univa Grid Engine doesn't
              know in which order the slave tasks have to be suspended.  If  a
              job  is  both  suspended  explicitly  and  via suspension of its
              queue, a following unsuspend of the queue will not  release  the
              suspension state on the job.

       --ssqq wwcc__qquueeuuee__lliisstt
              If  applied  to  queues,  suspends the queues and any jobs which
              might be active.  For parallel jobs, Univa Grid Engine sends the
              STOP  signal  to  the  master task only (see --ssjj switch). If any
              slave task of a parallel job runs in a queue that is to be  sus-
              pended,  the  master  task  of  this job is suspended, no matter
              where it is running.

              If  applied  to queues, unsuspends the queues and any jobs which
              might be active. If applied to jobs, unsuspends  the  jobs.  For
              parallel jobs, please see the --uussjj or --uussqq switch.

       --uussjj wwcc__jjoobb__rraannggee__lliisstt
              If  applied  to  jobs,  unsuspends  the jobs. For parallel jobs,
              Univa Grid Engine sends the CONT signal to the master task only.
              The  master  task  has  to  handle the unsuspending of all slave
              tasks itself then.  If a job is both  suspended  explicitly  and
              via  suspension of its queue, a following unsuspend of the queue
              will not release the suspension state on the  job.   A  parallel
              job is not un-suspended as long as at least one task of this job
              is suspended for any reason.

       --uussqq wwcc__qquueeuuee__lliisstt
              If applied to queues, unsuspends the queues and any  jobs  which

              CONT signal to the master task only (see --uussjj switch). A  paral-
