       The _q_a_c_c_t utility scans the accounting data  file  (see  _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g(5))
       and  produces  a  summary of information for wall-clock time, cpu-time,
       and system time for the categories of hostname, queue-name, group-name,
       owner-name,  job-name,  job-ID  and for the queues meeting the resource
       requirements as specified with the --ll  switch.   Combinations  of  each
       category  are  permitted.  Alternatively,  all  or specific jobs can be
       listed with the --jj switch.   For  example  the  search  criteria  could
       include summarizing for a queue and an owner, but not for two queues in
       the same request.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --aarr [aarr__iidd]
              The ID of the advance reservation for which usage is summarized.
              If  aarr__iidd  is  not  given,  accounting  data  is listed for each
              advance reservation separately.

       --AA aaccccoouunntt__ssttrriinngg
              The account for jobs to be summarized.

       --bb bbeeggiinn__ttiimmee
              The earliest start time for jobs to be summarized, in the format
              [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS].  See  also --dd option. If CC is not speci-
              fied, a YY of < 70 means 20YY.

       --dd ddaayyss
              The number of days to summarize and print accounting information
              on.  If used together with the --bb bbeeggiinn__ttiimmee option (see above),
              jobs started within bbeeggiinn__ttiimmee to bbeeggiinn__ttiimmee + ddaayyss are counted.
              If  used together with the --ee eenndd__ttiimmee (see below) option, count
              starts at eenndd__ttiimmee - ddaayyss.

       --ee eenndd__ttiimmee
              The latest start time for jobs to be summarized, in  the  format
              [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS].  See  also --dd option. If CC is not speci-
              fied, a YY of < 70 means 20YY.

       [--ff aaccccoouunnttiinngg__ffiillee]
              The accounting file to be used. If omitted, the  system  default
              accounting file is processed.

       --gg [ggrroouupp__iidd|ggrroouupp__nnaammee]
              The  numeric  system  group id or the group alphanumeric name of
              the  job  owners  to  be  included   in   the   accounting.   If
              ggrroouupp__iidd/ggrroouupp__nnaammee is omitted, all groups are accounted.

       --hh [hhoossttnnaammee]
              The  case-insensitive  name  of  the  host upon which accounting
              information is requested. If the name  is  omitted,  totals  for
              each host are listed separately.

       --hheellpp  Display help information for the _q_a_c_c_t command.

       --jj [jjoobb__iidd||jjoobb__nnaammee||ppaatttteerrnn]
              The name, a expression for matching names, or ID of the job dur-
              ing execution for which accounting information  is  printed.  If
              neither a name nor an ID is given all jobs are enlisted.
              This  option  changes  the output format of _q_a_c_c_t. If activated,
              CPU times are no longer accumulated  but  the  "raw"  accounting
              information  is  printed  in  a  formatted  form  instead.   See
              _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g(5) for an explanation of the displayed information.

       --ll aattttrr==vvaall,,......
              A resource requirement specification which must be  met  by  the
              queues  in  which  the  jobs being accounted were executing. The
              resource request  is  very  similar  to  the  one  described  in
              _q_s_u_b(1).

       --oo [oowwnneerr]
              The  name  of the owner of the jobs for which accounting statis-
              tics are assembled. If the optional oowwnneerr argument is omitted, a
              listing  of  the  accounting  statistics of all job owners being
              present in the accounting file is produced.

       --ppee [ppee__nnaammee]
              The name of the parallel environment for which usage  is  summa-
              rized.   If  ppee__nnaammee is not given, accounting data is listed for
              each parallel environment separately.

       --qq [wwcc__qquueeuuee__nnaammee]
              A expression for queues for which usage is summarized. All queue
              instances  matching the expression will be listed. If no expres-
              sion is specified, a cluster queue summary will be given.

       --ssii sseessssiioonn__iidd
              Requests sent by this client to the _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(1)  daemon  will
              be done as part of the specified session. If the switch is omit-
              ted or if NNOONNEE is specified as  sseessssiioonn__iidd  then  such  requests
              will be executed outside the control of a session.

              Find more information concerning sessions in _s_e_s_s_i_o_n___c_o_n_f(5).

       --sslloottss [sslloott__nnuummbbeerr]
              The  number  of  queue  slots for which usage is summarized.  If
              sslloott__nnuummbbeerr is not given, accounting data  is  listed  for  each
              number of queue slots separately.

       --tt ttaasskk__iidd__rraannggee__lliisstt
              Only available together with the --jj option described above.

              The  --tt  switch  specifies  the  array job task range, for which
              accounting information should be printed. Syntax  and  semantics
              of  ttaasskk__iidd__rraannggee__lliisstt are identical to that one described under
              the --tt option to _q_s_u_b(1).  Please see  there  also  for  further
              information on array jobs.

       --PP [pprroojjeecctt__nnaammee]
              The  name  of  the  project  for  which usage is summarized.  If
              pprroojjeecctt__nnaammee is not given, accounting data is  listed  for  each
              owning project separately.

       --DD [ddeeppaarrttmmeenntt__nnaammee]
              The  name  of  the department for which usage is summarized.  If
              ddeeppaarrttmmeenntt__nnaammee is not given, accounting data is listed for each
              owning department separately.

       SSGGEE__RROOOOTT       Specifies the location of the Univa Grid Engine standard
                      configuration files.

       SSGGEE__CCEELLLL       If set, specifies the default Univa Grid Engine cell. To
                      address  a  Univa  Grid  Engine  cell _q_a_c_c_t uses (in the
                      order of precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. ddeeffaauulltt.


       SSGGEE__DDEEBBUUGG__LLEEVVEELL
                      If set, specifies that debug information should be writ-
                      ten to stderr. In addition the level of detail in  which
                      debug information is generated is defined.

       SSGGEE__QQMMAASSTTEERR__PPOORRTT
                      If  set,  specifies the tcp port on which _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8)
                      is expected to listen for communication requests.   Most
                      installations will use a services map entry for the ser-
                      vice "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.

       SSGGEE__EEXXEECCDD__PPOORRTT If set, specifies the tcp port on which _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8)  is
                      expected  to  listen  for  communication requests.  Most
                      installations will use a services map entry for the ser-
                      vice "sge_execd" instead to define that port.
