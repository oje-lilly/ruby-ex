       _Q_r_d_e_l  provides  a  means  for a user/operator/manager to delete one or
       more Advance Reservations  (AR).  A  manager/operator  can  delete  ARs
       belonging  to any user, while a regular user can only delete his or her
       own ARs.  If a manager wants to delete another user's AR,  the  manager
       can specify the AR id.  By default, "qrdel wc_ar_name" will delete only
       the ARs belonging to that user. A manager is  able  to  delete  another
       user's  AR  via  "-u wc_user_list".  Jobs referring to an AR tagged for
       deletion will also be removed.  Only if all jobs referring to an AR are
       removed  from  the  Univa  Grid  Engine  database  will  the AR also be
       removed.

       _Q_r_d_e_l deletes ARs in the order in which the  AR  identifiers  are  pre-
       sented.   Find   additional  information  concerning  _w_c___u_s_e_r___l_i_s_t  and

       --ff     Force action for AR. The AR  and  the  jobs  using  the  AR  are
              deleted  from  the  Univa Grid Engine queuing system even if the
              _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8) controlling the AR jobs does  not  respond  to  the
              delete request sent by the _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8).
              Users  which have neither Univa Grid Engine manager nor operator
              status can only use the --ff option for their own ARs.

       --hheellpp  Prints a list of all options.

       --ssii sseessssiioonn__iidd
              Requests sent by this client to the _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(1)  daemon  will
              be done as part of the specified session. If the switch is omit-
              ted or if NNOONNEE is specified as  sseessssiioonn__iidd  then  such  requests
              will be executed outside the control of a session.

              Deletes  only  those ARs which were submitted by users specified
              in the list of usernames.  For managers, it is possible  to  use
              qqrrddeell --uu ""**"" to delete all ARs for all users. If a manager wants
              to delete a specific AR for a user, he has to specify  the  user
              and  the AR id. If no AR is specified, all ARs belonging to that
              user are deleted.

                      order of precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment

                      debug information is generated is defined.

                      _t_e_r(8) is expected to listen for communication requests.
                      Most installations will use a service map entry for  the
                      service "sge_qmaster" instead of defining the port.
