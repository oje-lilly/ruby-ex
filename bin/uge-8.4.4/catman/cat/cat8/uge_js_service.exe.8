       dows hosts. It is a Win32 service that is started at  boot  time  under
       the  "Local System" account, giving it the permissions to give any pro-
       cess the permissions to access the visible Desktop in order to let jobs
       display their GUI there.
       This  service  runs  independently  of the _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8) (i.e. it is not
       started and stopped together with the execution daemon) and  there  can
       be only one _u_g_e___j_s___s_e_r_v_i_c_e_._e_x_e _p_e_r _h_o_s_t_.

       Jobs  can  request  to  be  allowed to display their GUI on the visible
       desktop by requesting the  resource  "display_win_gui"  (qsub  -l  dis-
       play_win_gui=1).

       The Windows administrator can operate this service using the usual Win-
       dows Service Control Manager or the "net" command. The  "start"  method
       starts  the  service if possible, the "stop" method stops it regardless
       of any jobs that might be still running. For a graceful shutdown, first
       run  the "pause" method.  This will start the shutdown procedure of the
       service and prevent it from accepting any further jobs. After this, the
       "resume"  (aka  "continue")  method will fail as long as there are jobs
       running in the _u_g_e___j_s___s_e_r_v_i_c_e_._e_x_e_.  If no job is left in  the  service,
       the "resume" method will succeed and the service will stop.
