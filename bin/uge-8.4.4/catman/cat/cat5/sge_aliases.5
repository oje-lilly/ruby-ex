       sge_aliases - Univa Grid Engine path aliases file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  Univa  Grid  Engine path aliasing facility provides administrators
       and users with the means to reflect complicated and in-homogeneous file
       system structures in distributed environments (such as user home direc-
       tories mounted under different paths on different hosts) and to  ensure
       that Univa Grid Engine is able to locate the appropriate working direc-
       tories for executing batch jobs.

       There is a system global path aliasing file  and  a  user  local  file.
       _s_g_e___a_l_i_a_s_e_s defines the format of both:

       +o  Blank  lines  and  lines  with  a  '#'  sign in the first column are
          skipped.

       +o  Each line other than a blank line or a line lead by '#' has to  con-
          tain four strings separated by any number of blanks or tabs.

       +o  The  first string specifies a source-path, the second a submit-host,
          the third an execution-host and the fourth the source-path  replace-
          ment.

       +o  Both  the submit- and the execution-host entries may consist of only
          a '*' sign which matches any host.

       If the _-_c_w_d flag (and only if - otherwise the user's home directory  on
       the execution host is selected to execute the job) to _q_s_u_b(1) was spec-
       ified, the path aliasing mechanism is activated and the files are  pro-
       cessed as follows:

       +o  After  _q_s_u_b(1)  has retrieved the physical current working directory
          path, the cluster global path aliasing file is read if present.  The
          user  path aliases file is read afterwards as if it were appended to
          the global file.

       +o  Lines not to be skipped are read from the top of the file one by one
          while the translations specified by those lines are stored if neces-
          sary.

       +o  A translation is stored only if the submit-host  entry  matches  the
          host _q_s_u_b(1) is executed on and if the source-path forms the initial
          part either of the current working directory or of  the  source-path
          replacements already stored.

       +o  As  soon as both files are read the stored path aliasing information
          is passed along with the submitted job.

       +o  On the execution host, the aliasing information will  be  evaluated.
          The  leading  part of the current working directory will be replaced
          by the source-path replacement if the execution-host  entry  of  the
          path  alias  matches  the  executing host. NNoottee:: The current working
          directory string will be changed in this case  and  subsequent  path
          aliases  must  match  the  replaced  working  directory  path  to be
          applied.

       The following is a simple example of a  path  aliasing  file  resolving
       problems with in-homogeneous paths if _a_u_t_o_m_o_u_n_t(8) is used:


       =====================================================
       # Path Aliasing File
       # src-path   sub-host   exec-host   replacement
       /tmp_mnt/    *          *           /
       # replaces any occurrence of /tmp_mnt/ by /
       # if submitting or executing on any host.
       # Thus paths on nfs server and clients are the same
       =====================================================
