       qtask - file format of the qtask file.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       A  _q_t_a_s_k file defines which commands are submitted to Univa Grid Engine
       for remote execution by _q_t_c_s_h(1).  The _q_t_a_s_k file optionally  may  con-
       tain  _q_r_s_h(1)  command-line  parameters. These parameters are passed to
       the _q_r_s_h(1) command being used by _q_t_c_s_h to submit the commands.

       A cluster global _q_t_a_s_k file defining cluster wide defaults and  a  user
       specific  _q_t_a_s_k  file eventually overriding and enhancing those defini-
       tions   are   supported.   The   cluster   global   file   resides   at
       <sge_root>/<cell/common/qtask,  while  the  user  specific  file can be
       found at ~/.qtask. An exclamation mark preceding command definitions in
       the  cluster global can be used by the administrator to deny overriding
       of such commands by users.

FFOORRMMAATT
       The principle format of the _q_t_a_s_k file is that  of  a  tabulated  list.
       Each  line  starting  with a '#' character is a comment line. Each line
       despite comment lines defines a command to be started remotely.

       Definition starts with the command name that  must  match  exactly  the
       name  as typed in a _q_t_c_s_h(1) command-line. Pathnames are not allowed in
       _q_t_a_s_k files. Hence absolute or relative pathnames in _q_t_c_s_h(1)  command-
       lines  always  lead  to local execution even if the commands itself are
       the same as defined in the _q_t_a_s_k files.

       The command name can be followed by  an  arbitrary  number  of  _q_r_s_h(1)
       option arguments which are passed on to _q_r_s_h(1) by _q_t_c_s_h(1).

       An  exclamation  mark prefixing the command in the cluster global _q_t_a_s_k
       file prevents overriding by the user supplied _q_t_a_s_k file.

       The following _q_t_a_s_k file

              netscape -l a=sol-sparc64 -v DISPLAY=myhost:0
              grep -l h=filesurfer
              verilog -l veri_lic=1

       designates the applications netscape, grep and verilog for  interactive
       remote  execution  through  Univa Grid Engine. Netscape is requested to
       run only on Solaris64 architectures with the DISPLAY environment  vari-
       able  set  to 'myhost:0', grep only runs on the host named 'filesurfer'
       and verilog requests availability of a verilog license in order to  get
       executed remotely.
