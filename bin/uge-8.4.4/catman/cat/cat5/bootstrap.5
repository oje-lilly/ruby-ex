       bootstrap - Univa Grid Engine bootstrap file

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _b_o_o_t_s_t_r_a_p  contains parameters that are needed for the startup of Univa
       Grid Engine components.  It is created during the sge_qmaster installa-
       tion.  Modifying _b_o_o_t_s_t_r_a_p in a running system is not supported.


FFOORRMMAATT
       The paragraphs that follow provide brief descriptions of the individual
       parameters that compose the bootstrap configuration for  a  Univa  Grid
       Engine cluster:

   aaddmmiinn__uusseerr
       Administrative  user account used by Univa Grid Engine for all internal
       file handling (status spooling, message logging, etc.). Can be used  in
       cases  where  the  root  account  does  not have the corresponding file
       access permissions (e.g. on a shared file system  without  global  root
       read/write access).

       Being  a  parameter  set  at installation time changing aaddmmiinn__uusseerr in a
       running system is not supported. Changing it manually  on  a  shut-down
       cluster  is  possible,  but if access to the Univa Grid Engine spooling
       area is interrupted, this will result in unpredictable behavior.

       The aaddmmiinn__uusseerr parameter has  no  default  value,  but  instead  it  is
       defined during the master installation procedure.

   ddeeffaauulltt__ddoommaaiinn
       Only needed if your Univa Grid Engine cluster covers hosts belonging to
       more than a single DNS domain. In this case it  can  be  used  if  your
       hostname  resolving yields both qualified and unqualified hostnames for
       the hosts in one of the DNS domains.  The value  of  ddeeffaauulltt__ddoommaaiinn  is
       appended  to the unqualified hostname to define a fully qualified host-
       name.  The ddeeffaauulltt__ddoommaaiinn parameter will have no effect if  iiggnnoorree__ffqqddnn
       is set to "true".

       Being a parameter set at installation time changing ddeeffaauulltt__ddoommaaiinn in a
       running system is not supported.  The  default  for  ddeeffaauulltt__ddoommaaiinn  is
       "none", in which case it will not be used.

   iiggnnoorree__ffqqddnn
       Ignore  fully  qualified  domain name component of hostnames. Should be
       set if all hosts belonging to a Univa Grid Engine cluster are part of a
       single  DNS  domain.  It is switched on if set to either "true" or "1".
       Switching it on may solve problems with load reports due  to  different
       hostname resolutions across the cluster.

       Being  a  parameter  set at installation time changing iiggnnoorree__ffqqddnn in a
       running system is not supported. The default for iiggnnoorree__ffqqddnn is "true".

   ssppoooolliinngg__mmeetthhoodd
       Defines  how  _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8)  writes  its  configuration and the status
       information of a running cluster.

       The available spooling methods are _b_e_r_k_e_l_e_y_d_b, _p_o_s_t_g_r_e_s and _c_l_a_s_s_i_c.

   ssppoooolliinngg__lliibb
       The name of a shared  library  containing  the  ssppoooolliinngg__mmeetthhoodd  to  be
       loaded at _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8) initialization time.  The extension character-
       izing a shared library (.so, .sl, .dylib  etc.)  is  not  contained  in
       ssppoooolliinngg__lliibb.

       If  ssppoooolliinngg__mmeetthhoodd  was  set to _b_e_r_k_e_l_e_y_d_b during installation, ssppooooll--
       iinngg__lliibb is set to _l_i_b_s_p_o_o_l_b, if _p_o_s_t_g_r_e_s was chosen as ssppoooolliinngg__mmeetthhoodd,
       ssppoooolliinngg__lliibb  is  set  to  _l_i_b_s_p_o_o_l_p,  if  _c_l_a_s_s_i_c was chosen as ssppooooll--
       iinngg__mmeetthhoodd, ssppoooolliinngg__lliibb is set to _l_i_b_s_p_o_o_l_c.

       Not all operating systems allow the dynamic loading  of  libraries.  On
       these platforms a certain spooling method (default: berkeleydb) is com-
       piled into the binaries and the parameter ssppoooolliinngg__lliibb will be ignored.


   ssppoooolliinngg__ppaarraammss
       Defines parameters to the chosen spooling method.

       Parameters  that  are needed to initialize the spooling framework, e.g.
       to open database files or to connect to a certain database server.

       The spooling parameters value for spooling  method  _b_e_r_k_e_l_e_y_d_b  is  the
       path  to  the  database  directory, e.g. /sge_local/default/spool/qmas-
       ter/spooldb for spooling to a local filesystem.

       For spooling method _p_o_s_t_g_r_e_s the spooling parameters contain the  Post-
       greSQL   connection   string  in  Keyword/Value  format  documented  at
       http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/interactive/libpq-con-
       nect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING.

       For spooling method _c_l_a_s_s_i_c the spooling parameters take the form <com-
       mon_dir>;<qmaster     spool     dir>,      e.g.       /sge/default/com-
       mon;/sge/default/spool/qmaster

   bbiinnaarryy__ppaatthh
       The  directory  path where the Univa Grid Engine binaries reside. It is
       used within Univa Grid Engine components to locate  and  startup  other
       Univa Grid Engine programs.

       The path name given here is searched for binaries as well as any direc-
       tory below with a directory name equal to the current operating  system
       architecture.  Therefore, /usr/SGE/bin will work for all architectures,
       if the corresponding  binaries  are  located  in  subdirectories  named
       aix43, lx-amd64, lx-x86, hp11, hp11-64, sol-amd64, sol-sparc etc.

       The default location for the binary path is <sge_root>/bin


   qqmmaasstteerr__ssppooooll__ddiirr
       The  location  where  the  master  spool  directory  resides.  Only the
       _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8) and _s_g_e___s_h_a_d_o_w_d(8) need to have access  to  this  direc-
       tory.   The  master  spool  directory  -  in particular the job_scripts
       directory and the messages log file - may become quite large  depending
       on  the size of the cluster and the number of jobs. Be sure to allocate
       enough disk space and regularly clean off the log  files,  e.g.  via  a
       _c_r_o_n(8) job.

       Being  a  parameter set at installation time changing qqmmaasstteerr__ssppooooll__ddiirr
       in a running system is not supported.

       The   default   location   for   the   master   spool   directory    is
       <sge_root>/<cell>/spool/qmaster.


   sseeccuurriittyy__mmooddee
       The  security  mode  defines the set of security features the installed
       cluster is using.

       Possible security mode settings are none, afs, dce, kerberos, csp.  (no
       additional security, AFS, DCE, KERBEROS, CSP security model).

   lliisstteenneerr__tthhrreeaaddss
       The  default  for  this  parameter will be set to 2 during installation
       process.

       Listener threads are threads that do preliminary work  for  worker  and
       reader  threads  running  in  _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8).  At least two of them are
       required in a system.

   wwoorrkkeerr__tthhrreeaaddss
       The default for this parameter will be set  to  4  during  installation
       process.

       Defines  the number of worker threads that are started during _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_-
       _t_e_r(8) start. It is not possible to disable the worker thread pool  and
       the number of threads part of that pool cannot be adjusted dynamically.
       The change of this parameter requires a restart of _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8).

       The recommended value for this parameter is 4. If no server JSV is con-
       figured  then  it  is possible to reduce the value to 2 without perfor-
       mance loss.  Starting more than 4 threads will  not  improve  _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_-
       _t_e_r(8) scheduling and execution performance.  In rare cases more than 4
       threads might improve the cluster submit rate if a server JSV  is  con-
       figured that needs much time to verify one job.

   rreeaaddeerr__tthhrreeaaddss
       The default for this parameter will be set during installation process.

       The value 0 means that the reader thread pool is completely disabled in
       the  _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8) process. If the reader thread pool is disabled then
       all read-only and read-write requests will be  handled  by  the  worker
       threads.

       Values  between 1 and 64 will enable the reader thread pool. The corre-
       sponding number of reader threads will be part of the initially created
       read-only  thread pool when _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8) is started. This thread pool
       will then handle incoming read-only  requests  whereas  worker  threads
       will then handle read-write requests only.

       During  runtime  it is not possible to enable/disable the reader thread
       pool. To do so it is required to adjust the bootstrap parameter and  to
       restart _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8).

       In  systems  where  the reader thread pool is enabled it is possible to
       dynamically adjust the number of reader threads. The  _q_c_o_n_f(1)  -at/-kt
       switches  can  be  used to start/stop reader threads but any attempt to
       terminate the last 2 reader threads will be rejected  as  well  as  the
       attempt to start more that 64 threads.

   sscchheedduulleerr__tthhrreeaaddss
       The number of scheduler threads (allowed: 0-1, default set by installa-
       tion: 1, off: 0).  (see _q_c_o_n_f(1) -kt/-at option)

   jjvvmm__tthhrreeaaddss
       The number of JVM threads (allowed: 0-1, default set  by  installation,
       off: 0).
