       host_aliases - Univa Grid Engine host aliases file format

       All  Univa Grid Engine components use a hostname resolving service pro-
       vided by the communication library to identify hosts via a unique host-
       name.  The communication library itself references standard UNIX direc-
       tory services such as DNS, NIS and /etc/hosts to resolve hostnames.  In
       rare  cases  these  standard services cannot be setup cleanly and Univa
       Grid Engine communication daemons running on different hosts are unable
       to automatically determine a unique hostname for one or all hosts which
       can be used on all hosts. In such situations a Univa Grid  Engine  host
       aliases  file  can  be used to provide the communication daemons with a
       private and consistent hostname resolution database.

       The location  for  the  host  aliases  file  is  _<_s_g_e___r_o_o_t_>_/_<_c_e_l_l_>_/_c_o_m_-
       _m_o_n_/_h_o_s_t___a_l_i_a_s_e_s_.

       For  each  host  a  single line must be provided with a blank, comma or
       semicolon separated list  of  hostname  aliases.  The  first  alias  is
       defined  to be the uunniiqquuee hostname which will be used by all Univa Grid
       Engine components using the hostname aliasing service of the communica-
       tion library.
