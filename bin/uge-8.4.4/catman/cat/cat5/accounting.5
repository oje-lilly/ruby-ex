       accounting - Univa Grid Engine accounting file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       An  accounting  record  is  written to the Univa Grid Engine accounting
       file for each job having finished. The accounting file is processed  by
       _q_a_c_c_t(1) to derive accounting statistics.

FFOORRMMAATT
       Each  job  is represented by a line in the accounting file. Empty lines
       and lines which contain one character or less are ignored.   Accounting
       record  entries  are separated by colon (':') signs. The entries denote
       in their order of appearance:

   qqnnaammee
       Name of the cluster queue in which the job has run.

   hhoossttnnaammee
       Name of the execution host.

   ggrroouupp
       The effective group id of the job owner when executing the job.

   oowwnneerr
       Owner of the Univa Grid Engine job.

   jjoobb__nnaammee
       Job name.

   jjoobb__nnuummbbeerr
       Job identifier - job number.

   aaccccoouunntt
       An account string as specified by the _q_s_u_b(1) or _q_a_l_t_e_r(1) --AA option.

   pprriioorriittyy
       Priority value assigned to the job corresponding to the pprriioorriittyy param-
       eter in the queue configuration (see _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5)).

   ssuubbmmiissssiioonn__ttiimmee
       Submission time (64bit GMT unix time stamp in milliseconds).

   ssttaarrtt__ttiimmee
       Start time (64bit GMT unix time stamp in milliseconds).

   eenndd__ttiimmee
       End time (64bit GMT unix time stamp in milliseconds).

   ffaaiilleedd
       Indicates the problem which occurred in case a job could not be started
       on the execution host (e.g. because the owner of the job did not have a
       valid  account  on that machine). If Univa Grid Engine tries to start a
       job multiple times, this may lead to multiple entries in the accounting
       file corresponding to the same job ID.

   eexxiitt__ssttaattuuss
       Exit  status of the job script (or Univa Grid Engine specific status in
       case of certain error conditions).  The exit status  is  determined  by
       following the normal shell conventions.  If the command terminates nor-
       mally the value of the command is its exit  status.   However,  in  the
       case  that  the  command exits abnormally, a value of 0200 (octal), 128
       (decimal) is added to the value of the command  to  make  up  the  exit
       status.

              For  example:  If a job dies through signal 9 (SIGKILL) then the
              exit status becomes 128 + 9 = 137.

   rruu__wwaallllcclloocckk
       Difference between eenndd__ttiimmee and ssttaarrtt__ttiimmee (see above).

       The remainder of the accounting entries follows  the  contents  of  the
       standard UNIX rusage structure as described in _g_e_t_r_u_s_a_g_e(2).  Depending
       on the operating system where the job was executed some of  the  fields
       may be 0.  The following entries are provided:

              rruu__uuttiimmee
              rruu__ssttiimmee

              rruu__mmssggssnndd
              rruu__mmssggrrccvv
              rruu__nnssiiggnnaallss
              rruu__nnvvccssww

   ddeeppaarrttmmeenntt
       The department which was assigned to the job.

   ggrraanntteedd__ppee
       The parallel environment which was selected for that job.

   sslloottss

   mmeemm
       The integral memory usage in Gbytes cpu seconds.

   iioo
       The amount of data transferred in Gbytes.  On  Linux  data  transferred
       means  all  bytes  read  and  written  by  the  job through the read(),
       pread(), write() and pwrite() systems calls.

   ccaatteeggoorryy
       A string specifying the job category.

   iiooww
       The io wait time in seconds.

   iiooooppss
       The number of io operations.

   ppee__ttaasskkiidd
       If this identifier is set the task was part of a parallel job  and  was
       passed to Univa Grid Engine via the qrsh -inherit interface.

   mmaaxxvvmmeemm
       The maximum vmem size in bytes.

   aarriidd
       Advance reservation identifier. If the job used resources of an advance
       reservation then this field contains a positive integer identifier oth-
       erwise the value is "00" .

   aarr__ssuubbmmiissssiioonn__ttiimmee
       If  the  job  used  resources of an advance reservation then this field
       contains the submission time (64bit GMT unix time  stamp  in  millisec-
       onds) of the advance reservation, otherwise the value is "00" .

   jjoobb__ccllaassss
       If  the job has been running in a job class, the name of the job class,
       otherwise "NNOONNEE" .

   qqddeell__iinnffoo
       If the job  (the  array  task)  has  been  deleted  via  qdel,  "<<uusseerr--
       nnaammee>>@@<<hhoossttnnaammee>>",  else  "NNOONNEE".   If  qdel was called multiple times,
       every invocation is recorded in a comma separated list.

   ccwwdd
       The working directory the job ran in as specified with  qsub  /  qalter
       switches  -cwd  and  -wd.  As the delimiter used by the accounting file
       (colon ":") can be part of the working  directory  all  colons  in  the
       working directory are replaced by ASCII code 255.

   ssuubbmmiitt__ccmmdd
       The command line used for job submission.  As the delimiter used by the
       accounting file (colon ":") can be part of the command line all  colons
       in  the  command line are replaced by ASCII code 255.  Line feeds being
       part of the command line will be replaced by a  space  character.   The
       qacct  client  converts them back to colon.  For jobs submitted via the
       DRMAA interface or via qmon graphical  user  interface  the  accounting
       file contains "NONE" as submit_cmd.

   wwaallllcclloocckk
       The  wallclock time the job spent in running state.  Times during which
       the job was suspended are not counted as wallclock time.   For  loosely
       integrated jobs and for tightly integrated jobs with accounting summary
       enabled the wallclock time reported for the master task  is  the  wall-
       clock time multiplied by the number of job slots.
