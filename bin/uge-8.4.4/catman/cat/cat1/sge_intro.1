       Univa  Grid  Engine  -  a  facility  for  executing UNIX jobs on remote
       machines

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Univa Grid Engine is a facility for executing UNIX  batch  jobs  (shell
       scripts)  on  a  pool  of cooperating workstations. Jobs are queued and
       executed remotely on workstations  at  times  when  those  workstations
       would  otherwise  be idle or only lightly loaded. The work load is dis-
       tributed among the workstations in the  cluster  corresponding  to  the
       load  situation  of  each  machine and the resource requirements of the
       jobs.

       User level checkpointing  programs  are  supported  and  a  transparent
       checkpointing  mechanism  is provided (see _s_g_e___c_k_p_t(1)).  Checkpointing
       jobs migrate from workstation to workstation without user  intervention
       on  load demand. In addition to batch jobs, interactive jobs and paral-
       lel jobs can also be submitted to Univa Grid Engine.


UUSSEERR IINNTTEERRFFAACCEE
       The Univa Grid Engine user interface consists of several programs which
       are described separately.

       _q_a_c_c_t(1)
              _q_a_c_c_t extracts arbitrary accounting information from the cluster
              logfile.

       _q_a_l_t_e_r(1)
              _q_a_l_t_e_r changes the characteristics of already submitted jobs.

       _q_c_o_n_f(1)
              _q_c_o_n_f provides the user interface  for  configuring,  modifying,
              deleting and querying queues and the cluster configuration.

       _q_d_e_l(1)
              _q_d_e_l  provides  the  means for a user/operator/manager to cancel
              jobs.

       _q_h_o_l_d(1)
              _q_h_o_l_d holds back submitted jobs from execution.

       _q_h_o_s_t(1)
              _q_h_o_s_t displays status information about Univa Grid Engine execu-
              tion hosts.

       _q_l_o_g_i_n(1)
              _q_l_o_g_i_n  initiates  a  telnet or similar login session with auto-
              matic selection of a low loaded and suitable host.

       _q_m_a_k_e(1)
              _q_m_a_k_e is a replacement for the standard Unix _m_a_k_e  facility.  It
              extends make by its ability to distribute independent make steps
              across a cluster of suitable machines.

       _q_m_o_d(1)
              _q_m_o_d allows the owner(s) of a queue to suspend  and  enable  all
              queues  associated  with  his machine (all currently active pro-
              cesses in this queue are also signaled) or to suspend and enable
              jobs executing in the owned queues.

       _q_m_o_n(1)
              _q_m_o_n provides a Motif command interface to all Univa Grid Engine
              functions. The status of all  or  a  private  selection  of  the
              configured  queues  is  displayed  on-line by changing colors at
              corresponding queue icons.

       _q_q_u_o_t_a(1)
              _q_q_u_o_t_a provides a status listing of all currently used  resource
              quotas (see _s_g_e___r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e___q_u_o_t_a(1).)

       _q_r_e_s_u_b(1)
              _q_r_e_s_u_b  creates new jobs by copying currently running or pending
              jobs.

       _q_r_l_s(1)
              _q_r_l_s releases holds from jobs previously assigned to  them  e.g.
              via _q_h_o_l_d(1) (see above).

       _q_r_d_e_l(1)
              _q_r_d_e_l provides the means to cancel advance reservations.

       _q_r_s_h(1)
              _q_r_s_h  can  be used for various purposes such as providing remote
              execution of interactive applications via Univa Grid Engine com-
              parable to the standard Unix facility rsh, to allow for the sub-
              mission of batch jobs which, upon  execution,  support  terminal
              I/O (standard/error output and standard input) and terminal con-
              trol, to provide a batch job  submission  client  which  remains
              active until the job has finished or to allow for the Univa Grid
              Engine-controlled remote execution  of  the  tasks  of  parallel
              jobs.

       _q_r_s_t_a_t(1)
              _q_r_s_t_a_t  provides a status listing of all advance reservations in
              the cluster.

       _q_r_s_u_b(1)
              _q_r_s_u_b is the user interface for submitting a advance reservation
              to Univa Grid Engine.

       _q_s_e_l_e_c_t(1)
              _q_s_e_l_e_c_t  prints a list of queue names corresponding to specified
              selection criteria. The output of _q_s_e_l_e_c_t is  usually  fed  into
              other  Univa Grid Engine commands to apply actions on a selected
              set of queues.

       _q_s_h(1) _q_s_h opens an interactive shell (in an _x_t_e_r_m(1)) on a low  loaded
              host. Any kind of interactive jobs can be run in this shell.

       _q_s_t_a_t(1)
              _q_s_t_a_t  provides  a status listing of all jobs and queues associ-
              ated with the cluster.

       _q_t_c_s_h(1)
              _q_t_c_s_h is a fully compatible replacement for the widely known and
              used  Unix C-Shell (_c_s_h) derivative _t_c_s_h. It provides a command-
              shell with the extension of transparently distributing execution
              of  designated applications to suitable and lightly loaded hosts
              via Univa Grid Engine.

       _q_s_u_b(1)
              _q_s_u_b is the user interface for submitting a job  to  Univa  Grid
              Engine.
