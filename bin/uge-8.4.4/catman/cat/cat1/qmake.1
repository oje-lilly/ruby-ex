       _Q_m_a_k_e  is  a  parallel,  distributed _m_a_k_e(1) utility. Scheduling of the
       parallel _m_a_k_e tasks is done by Univa Grid Engine. It is based on  _g_m_a_k_e
       (GNU  make), version 4.0. Both Univa Grid Engine and _g_m_a_k_e command line
       options can be specified. They are separated by "--".

       All Univa Grid Engine options valid with  _q_s_u_b(1)  or  _q_r_s_h(1)  can  be
       specified  with  _q_m_a_k_e  -  see _s_u_b_m_i_t(1) for a description of all Univa
       Grid Engine command line options.  The _m_a_k_e(1)  manual  page  describes
       the _g_m_a_k_e command line syntax.

       The  syntax of _q_m_a_k_e makefiles corresponds to _g_m_a_k_e and is described in
       the "GNU Make Manual".

       A typical qmake call will  use  the  Univa  Grid  Engine  command  line
       options  -cwd  to  have a scheduled make started in the current working
       directory on the execution host, -v PATH if the Univa Grid Engine envi-
       ronment  is  not  setup  in the users .cshrc or .profile shell resource
       file and request slots in a parallel environment (see _s_g_e___p_e(5) ).

       If no resource request (Univa Grid Engine command line  option  -l)  is
       specified,  qmake will use the environment variable SGE_ARCH to request
       the same architecture for task execution as has the  submit  host.   If
       SGE_ARCH  is  set,  the  architecture  specified  in  SGE_ARCH  will be
       requested by inserting the option -l arch=$SGE_ARCH  into  the  command
       line  options.   If SGE_ARCH is not set, the make tasks can be executed
       on any available architecture.  As this is critical  for  typical  make
       (compile) jobs, a warning will be output.

       _q_m_a_k_e  has  two  different  modes  for  allocating  Univa  Grid  Engine
       resources for the parallel execution of tasks:

       1. Allocation of resources using a parallel  environment.  If  the  -pe
       option  is  used on the qmake command line, a parallel job is scheduled
       by Univa Grid Engine.  The make rules are executed as tasks within this
       parallel job.

       2.  Dynamic  allocation  of  resources.  If  no parallel environment is
       requested when submitting a qmake job, each make rule will generate  an
       individual  Univa Grid Engine qrsh job.  All resource requests given to
       qmake will be inherited by the jobs processing the make rules.

       In dynamic allocation mode, additional resource requests for individual
       rules  can  be  specified by preceding the rule by the definition of an
       environment  variable  SGE_RREQ.  The  rule   then   takes   the   form
       SGE_RREQ="<request>"  <rule>,  e.g.   SGE_RREQ="-l lic=1" cc -c ...  If
       such makefile rules are executed in a make utility  other  than  qmake,
       the environment variable SGE_RREQ will be set in the environment estab-
       lished for the rule's execution - without any effect.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
              qmake -cwd -v PATH -pe compiling 1-10 --

       will  request  between  1  and  10  slots   in   parallel   environment
       "compiling".   If  the  SGE_ARCH  environment  variable  is  set to the
       machines architecture, a resource request will  be  inserted  into  the
       qmake  command  line to start the qmake job on the same architecture as
       the submit host. The _m_a_k_e tasks will inherit the  complete  environment
       of  the  calling shell. It will execute as many parallel tasks as slots
       have been granted by Univa Grid Engine.

              qmake -l arch=sol-sparc -cwd -v PATH -- -j 4

       will submit each make rule as an individual qrsh job. A  maximum  of  4
       tasks  will be processed in parallel.  The qmake job will be started on
       a machine of architecture sol-sparc, this resource request will also be
       inherited by the make tasks, i.e. all jobs created for the execution of
       make tasks will request the architecture sol-sparc.

       If the following Makefile is submitted with  the  above  command  line,
       additional resource requests will be made for individual rules: For the
       compile and link rules, compiler licenses (comp)  and  linker  licenses
       (link)  will be requested, in addition to the resource request made for
       the whole job (-l arch=sol-sparc) on the command line.

              all: test

              clean:
                   rm -f test main.o functions.o

              test: main.o functions.o
                   SGE_RREQ="-l link=1" ld -o test main.o functions.o

              main.o: main.c
                   SGE_RREQ="-l comp=1" cc -c -DALIASPATH=

              functions.o: functions.c
                   SGE_RREQ="-l comp=1" cc -c -DALIASPATH=


       The command line
              qmake -cwd -v PATH -l arch=sol-sparc64 -pe make 3 --

       will request 3 parallel _m_a_k_e tasks to be executed on hosts of architec-
       ture  "sol-sparc64".  The submit may be done on a host of any architec-
       ture.

       The shell script

              #!/bin/sh
              qmake -inherit --

       can be submitted by

              qsub -cwd -v PATH -pe make 1-10 [further sge options] <script>

       _Q_m_a_k_e will inherit the resources granted for the  job  submitted  above
       under parallel environment "make".

       SSGGEE__CCEELLLL       If set, specifies the default Univa Grid Engine cell. To
                      address  a  Univa  Grid  Engine  cell _q_m_a_k_e uses (in the
                      order of precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. ddeeffaauulltt.

                      ten to stderr. In addition the level of detail in  which
                      debug information is generated is defined.

       SSGGEE__AARRCCHH       The architecture of the submit host. If this variable is
                      set in the submission environment,  qmake  will  request
                      the  given  architecture for job execution (see DESCRIP-
                      TION above).

       Very low file server performance may  lead  to  problems  on  depending
       files.

       Example: Host a compiles a.c to a.o, host b compiles b.c to b.o, host c
       shall link program c from a.o and b.o. In case of very bad NFS  perfor-
       mance, host c might not yet see files a.o and b.o.

       If  multiple  commands  are  executed  in one rule, the makefile has to
       ensure that they are handled as one command line.

       Example:

              libx.a:
                     cd x
                     ar ru libx.a x.o

       Building libx.a will fail, if the commands  are  executed  in  parallel
       (and possibly on different hosts). Write the following instead:

              libx.a:
                     cd x ; ar ru libx.a x.o

       or

              libx.a:
                     cd x ; \
                     ar ru libx.a x.o
