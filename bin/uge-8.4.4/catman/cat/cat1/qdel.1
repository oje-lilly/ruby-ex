       _Q_d_e_l provides a means for a user/operator/manager to delete one or more
       jobs. A manager/operator can delete jobs belonging to any user, while a
       regular user can only delete his or her own jobs.  If a  manager  wants
       to  delete  another  user's job, the manager can specify the job id. If
       the manager is using a job name or pattern, he or she must also specify
       the user's name via "-u wc_user_list". A "qdel wc_job_name" will delete
       only the jobs of the calling user by default.  _Q_d_e_l deletes jobs in the
       order  in  which  their  job identifiers are presented. Find additional
       information concerning _w_c___u_s_e_r___l_i_s_t and _w_c___j_o_b___l_i_s_t in _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1).

       --ff     Force deletion of job(s). The job(s) are deleted from  the  list
              of  jobs  registered  at _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8) even if the _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8)
              controlling the job(s) does not respond to  the  delete  request
              sent by _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8).

              Users which are neither Univa Grid Engine managers nor operators
              can only use the --ff option (for their own jobs) if  the  cluster
              configuration    entry    qqmmaasstteerr__ppaarraammss   contains   the   flag
              ENABLE_FORCED_QDEL (see  _s_g_e___c_o_n_f(5)).   However,  behavior  for
              administrative  and  non-administrative  users differs. Jobs are
              deleted from the Univa Grid Engine database immediately in  case
              of  administrators.  Otherwise,  a regular deletion is attempted
              first and a forced cancellation is only executed if the  regular
              deletion was unsuccessful.

              Additionally  regular qdel requests can result in a forced dele-
              tion of a job if EENNAABBLLEE__FFOORRCCEEDD__QQDDEELL__IIFF__UUNNKKNNOOWWNN  is  set  in  the
              qqmmaasstteerr__ppaarraammss (see _s_g_e___c_o_n_f(5))

       --hheellpp  Prints a listing of all options.

       --ssii sseessssiioonn__iidd
              Requests  sent  by this client to the _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(1) daemon will
              be done as part of the specified session. If the switch is omit-
              ted  or  if  NNOONNEE  is specified as sseessssiioonn__iidd then such requests
              will be executed outside the control of a session.

       --tt     Deletes specified tasks of array job. It means tasks created  by
              qsub -t command. For example after creating array job by command
              "qsub -t 1-100 $SGE_ROOT/examples/sleeper.sh" it is possible  to
              delete  tasks  5-10  from  job  array by command "qdel job_id -t
              5-10".  All other tasks (1-4 and 11-100) will be executed.

       --uu wwcc__uusseerr__lliisstt
              Deletes only those jobs which were submitted by users  specified
              in  the  list  of usernames.  For managers it is possible to use
              qqddeell --uu ""**"" to delete all jobs of all users. If a manager  wants
              to  delete  a specific job of a user, he has to specify the user
              and the job. If no job is specified all jobs from that user  are
              deleted.

       SSGGEE__CCEELLLL       If set, specifies the default Univa Grid Engine cell. To
                      address a Univa Grid Engine cell _q_d_e_l uses (in the order
                      of precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. ddeeffaauulltt.

                      debug information is generated is defined.

                      is expected to listen for communication requests.   Most
                      installations will use a services map entry for the ser-
                      vice "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.
