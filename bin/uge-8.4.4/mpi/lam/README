Tight integration for lam was tested with version
lam-7.1.4.

Building lam mpi
================
Configure, make and make install lam mpi.

In order for tight integration of LAM MPI with Grid Engine to work you need
to start lamd through a wrapper script.

Change to the installed bin directory.
mv lamd lamd_binary
cp $SGE_ROOT/mpi/lam/lamd_wrapper .
ln -s lamd_wrapper lamd

Installing the PE
=================
Edit $SGE_ROOT/mpi/lam/lam.template,
replace <path to LAM installation> with the absolute path to your lam installation.

qconf -Ap $SGE_ROOT/mpi/lam/lam.template

Calling lamboot and lamhalt outside of the preinstalled pe start/stop procedure:
================================================================================
lamboot and lamhalt are usually started by the pe start and stop procedure delivered
with Univa Grid Engine.

Sometimes it may be desirable to start lamboot and lamhalt as part of the job script.
To make sure to point lamboot to the correct lam installation on the remote hosts
call lamboot -prefix <path to the lam install directory>
