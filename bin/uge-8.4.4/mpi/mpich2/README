Tight integration for mpich2 was tested with version
mpich2-1.4.1p1.

Building mpich2
===============
No special options are needed for configuration and build of mpich2.
Grid Engine tight integration is enabled by default.

Installing the PE
=================
qconf -Ap $SGE_ROOT/mpi/mpich2/mpich2.template

Note
====
In the tested version 1.4.1p1 mpirun correctly recognizes UGE as
resource management system and starts slave tasks via
qrsh -inherit <host> <command>
On the master node slave tasks are started via fork/exec, therefore the
PE attribute master_forks_slaves is set to TRUE.
Should your specific mpich2 version behave differently and you see
qrsh -inherit calls done to the master node failing,
set master_forks_slaves to FALSE.
