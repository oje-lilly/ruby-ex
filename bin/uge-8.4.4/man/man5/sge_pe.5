.SH NAME
sge_pe \- Univa Grid Engine parallel environment configuration file format
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Parallel environments are parallel programming and runtime environments
allowing for the execution of shared memory or distributed memory
parallelized applications. Parallel environments usually require some
kind of setup to be operational before starting parallel applications.
Examples for common parallel environments are shared memory parallel
operating systems and the distributed memory environments Parallel Virtual
Machine (PVM) or Message Passing Interface (MPI).
.PP
.I sge_pe
allows for the definition of interfaces to arbitrary parallel environments.
Once a parallel environment is defined or modified with the \fB\-ap\fP or
\fB\-mp\fP options to
.M qconf 1
and linked with one or more queues via \fIpe_list\fP in 
.M queue_conf 5
the environment can be requested for a job via the \fB\-pe\fP switch
to
.M qsub 1
together with a request of a range for the number of parallel processes
to be allocated by the job. Additional \fB\-l\fP options may be used
to specify the job requirement to further detail.
.PP
Note, Univa Grid Engine allows backslashes (\\) be used to escape newline
(\\newline) characters. The backslash and the newline are replaced with a
space (" ") character before any interpretation.
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
The format of a
.I sge_pe
file is defined as follows:
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBpe_name\fP"
The name of the parallel environment as defined for \fIpe_name\fP in
.M sge_types 1 . 
To be used in the
.M qsub 1
\fB\-pe\fP switch.
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBslots\fP"
The number of parallel processes being allowed to run in total under the
parallel environment concurrently.
Type is number, valid values are 0 to 9999999.
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBuser_lists\fP"
A comma separated list of user access list names (see
.M access_list 5 ).
Each user contained in at least one of the enlisted access lists has
access to the parallel environment. If the \fBuser_lists\fP parameter is set to
NONE (the default) any user has access being not explicitly excluded
via the \fBxuser_lists\fP parameter described below.
If a user is contained both in an access list enlisted in \fBxuser_lists\fP
and \fBuser_lists\fP the user is denied access to the parallel environment.
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBxuser_lists\fP"
The \fBxuser_lists\fP parameter contains a comma separated list of so called
user access lists as described in
.M access_list 5 .
Each user contained in at least one of the enlisted access lists is not
allowed to access the parallel environment. If the \fBxuser_lists\fP
parameter is set to NONE (the default) any user has access. If a user
is contained both in an access list enlisted in \fBxuser_lists\fP and
\fBuser_lists\fP the user is denied access to the parallel environment.
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBstart_proc_args\fP"
The invocation command line of a start-up procedure for the parallel
environment or the keyword NONE if no startup-script should be executed. 
The start-up procedure is invoked by
.M sge_shepherd 8
for the master task of a parallel job after a possibly configured prolog (see
.M sge_conf 5 )
and prior to executing the job script. Its purpose is to setup the
parallel environment correspondingly to its needs.
An optional prefix "user@" specifies the user under which this 
procedure is to be started.
The standard output of the start-up
procedure is redirected to the file \fIREQUEST\fP.po\fIJID\fP in the
job's working 
directory (see
.M qsub 1 ),
with \fIREQUEST\fP being the name of the job as 
displayed by
.M qstat 1
and \fIJID\fP being the job's identification number.
Likewise, 
the standard error output is redirected to \fIREQUEST\fP.pe\fIJID\fP
.br
Scripts where the execution duration would exceed 2 minutes will be
terminated. This timeout can be adjusted by defining \fBSCRIPT_TIMEOUT\fP
as \fBexecd_param\fP in the configuration.
.br
The following special
variables being expanded at runtime can be used (besides any other
strings which have to be interpreted by the start and stop procedures)
to constitute a command line:
.IP "\fI$pe_hostfile\fP"
The pathname of a file containing
a detailed description of the layout of the parallel environment to be
setup by the start-up procedure. Each line of the file refers to a host
on which parallel processes are to be run. The first entry of each line
denotes the hostname, the second entry the number of parallel processes
to be run on the host, the third entry the name of the queue, and the
fourth entry a processor range to be used in case of a multiprocessor
machine.
.IP "\fI$host\fP"
The name of the host on which the start-up or stop procedures are
started.
.IP "\fI$job_owner\fP"
The user name of the job owner.
.IP "\fI$job_id\fP"
Univa Grid Engine's unique job identification number.
.IP "\fI$job_name\fP"
The name of the job.
.IP "\fI$pe\fP"
The name of the parallel environment in use.
.IP "\fI$pe_slots\fP"
Number of slots granted for the job.
.IP "\fI$processors\fP"
The \fBprocessors\fP string as contained in the queue configuration
(see
.M queue_conf 5 )
of the master queue (the queue in which the start-up and stop procedures
are started).
.IP "\fI$queue\fP"
The cluster queue of the master queue instance.
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBstop_proc_args\fP"
The invocation command line of a shutdown procedure for the parallel
environment or the keyword NONE if no shutdown procedure should be executed. 
The shutdown procedure is invoked by
.M sge_shepherd 8
after the job script has finished, but before a possibly configured epilog (see
.M sge_conf 5 )
is started. Its purpose is to stop the parallel environment and to remove it
from all participating systems.
An optional prefix "user@" specifies the user under which this 
procedure is to be started.
The standard output of the stop
procedure is also redirected to the file \fIREQUEST\fP.po\fIJID\fP in the
job's working 
directory (see
.M qsub 1 ),
with \fIREQUEST\fP being the name of the job as 
displayed by
.M qstat 1
and \fIJID\fP being the job's identification number.
Likewise, 
the standard error output is redirected to \fIREQUEST\fP.pe\fIJID\fP
.br
Scripts where the execution duration would exceed 2 minutes will be
terminated. This timeout can be adjusted by defining \fBSCRIPT_TIMEOUT\fP
as \fBexecd_param\fP in the configuration.
.br
The same special variables as for \fBstart_proc_args\fP
can be used to constitute a command line.
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBallocation_rule\fP"
The allocation rule is interpreted by the scheduler thread
and helps the scheduler to decide how to distribute parallel
processes among the available machines. If, for instance,
a parallel environment is built for shared memory applications
only, all parallel processes have to be assigned to a single
machine, no matter how much suitable machines are available.
If, however, the parallel environment follows the
distributed memory paradigm, an even distribution of processes
among machines may be favorable.
.br
The allocation rule always refers to hosts, not to queues. So if there are
specific queues requested for the parallel job, e.g. using the "-q" or
"-masterq" switch (see
.M qsub 1 )
the tasks of the job might get distributed over several queues, but the sum of
tasks on one host will be always the one defined by the allocation rule.
.br
The current version of the scheduler only understands the
following allocation rules:
.IP "\fB<int>\fP:" 1i
An integer number fixing the number of processes per host. If the number
is 1, all processes have to reside on different hosts.
If the number of tasks specified with the "-pe" option (see
.M qsub 1 )
does not divide without remainder by this <int> the job will not be scheduled.
If there was a master queue requested by the "-masterq" option and a list of
queues for the slave tasks by the "-q" option (see
.M qsub 1 ),
and if the master queue is not part of the slave queue list, then the job will
be scheduled only if the number of tasks subtracted by one divides without
reminder by this <int>.
.br
If the special denominator
.B $pe_slots
is used, the full range of processes as specified with the
.M qsub 1
\fB\-pe\fP switch has to be allocated on a single host
(no matter which value belonging to the range is finally
chosen for the job to be allocated).
.IP "\fB$fill_up\fP:" 1i
Starting from the best suitable host/queue, all available slots are 
allocated. Further hosts and queues are "filled up" as long as a job still 
requires slots for parallel tasks.
.IP "\fB$round_robin\fP:" 1i
From all suitable hosts a single slot is allocated until all tasks 
requested by the parallel job are dispatched. If more tasks are requested 
than suitable hosts are found, allocation starts again from the first host. 
The allocation scheme walks through suitable hosts in a best-suitable-first 
order.
.P
\fBNote\fP: If the master queue (i.e. the queue where the master task
of the parallel job is located) is not requested explicitly, these allocation
rules are always obeyed exactly.
.br
If a master queue is requested explicitly by
adding the \fB\-masterq\fP switch to the submit command line (see
.M submit 1 ),
then the Scheduler tries to fulfill both the allocation rule and the master queue
request, which are possibly contrary requirements. If
the allocation rule and the distribution of both the master queue and the slave
queues over the execution hosts allow to make one of these tasks the master task,
then both the \fB\-masterq\fP request and
the allocation rule are obeyed exactly. If this is not possible, then the Scheduler
automatically adds one task that will become the master task.
.br
Generally, the Scheduler will have to add one task for fixed allocation rules
(i.e. "<int>" or "$pe_slots") if the requested master queue is not part of the
set of slave queues and none of the slave queues has an instance on the master host.
The exception of this rule is an allocation rule of "1".
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBcontrol_slaves\fP"
This parameter can be set to TRUE or FALSE (the default). It indicates 
whether Univa Grid Engine is the creator of the slave tasks of a parallel application
via 
.M sge_execd 8
and
.M sge_shepherd 8
and thus has full control over all 
processes in a parallel application, which enables capabilities such as 
resource limitation and correct accounting. However, to gain control over
the 
slave tasks of a parallel application, a sophisticated PE interface is
required, 
which works closely together with Univa Grid Engine facilities. Such PE interfaces are 
available through your local Univa Grid Engine support office.
.sp 1
Please set the control_slaves parameter to false for all other PE
interfaces.
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBjob_is_first_task\fP"
The
.B job_is_first_task
parameter can be set to TRUE or FALSE. A value of 
TRUE indicates that the Univa Grid Engine job script already contains one of 
the tasks of the parallel application
(the number of slots reserved for the job is the number of slots requested with the -pe switch),
while a value of FALSE indicates that the
job script (and its child processes) is not part of the parallel program
(the number of slots reserved for the job is the number of slots requested with the -pe switch + 1).
.PP
If wallclock accounting is used 
(execd_params ACCT_RESERVED_USAGE and/or SHARETREE_RESERVED_USAGE set to TRUE)
and 
.B control_slaves
is set to FALSE, the
.B job_is_first_task
parameter influences the accounting for the job:
A value of TRUE means that accounting for cpu and requested memory gets multiplied by the number of slots requested with the -pe switch, if
.B job_is_first_task
is set to FALSE, the accounting information gets multiplied by number of slots + 1.
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBurgency_slots\fP"
For pending jobs with a slot range PE request the number of slots 
is not determined. This setting specifies the method to be used by 
Univa Grid Engine to assess the number of slots such jobs might finally
get.
.PP
The assumed slot allocation has a meaning when determining the 
resource-request-based priority contribution for numeric resources
as described in
.M sge_priority 5 
and is displayed when 
.M qstat 1 
is run without \fB\-g t\fP option.
.PP
The following methods are supported:
.IP "\fB<int>\fP:" 1i
The specified integer number is directly used as prospective slot amount.
.IP "\fBmin\fP:" 1i
The slot range minimum is used as prospective slot amount. If no 
lower bound is specified with the range 1 is assumed.
.IP "\fBmax\fP:" 1i
The of the slot range maximum is used as prospective slot amount. 
If no upper bound is specified with the range the absolute maximum 
possible due to the PE's \fBslots\fP setting is assumed.
.IP "\fBavg\fP:" 1i
The average of all numbers occurring within the job's PE range 
request is assumed.
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBaccounting_summary\fP"
This parameter is only checked if
.B control_slaves
(see above) is set to TRUE 
and thus Univa Grid Engine is the creator of the slave tasks of a parallel 
application via
.M sge_execd 8
and
.M sge_shepherd 8 .
In this case, accounting information is available for every single
slave task started by Univa Grid Engine.
.PP
The
.B accounting_summary
parameter can be set to TRUE or FALSE. A value of 
TRUE indicates that only a single accounting record is written to the
.M accounting 5
file, containing the accounting summary of the whole job including all slave tasks,
while a value of FALSE indicates an individual
.M accounting 5
record is written for every slave task, as well as for the master task.
.br
.B Note:
When running tightly integrated jobs with \fISHARETREE_RESERVED_USAGE\fP set,
and with having \fIaccounting_summary\fP enabled in the parallel environment,
reserved usage will only be reported by the master task of the parallel job.
No per parallel task usage records will be sent from execd to qmaster, which 
can significantly reduce load on qmaster when running large tightly integrated parallel jobs.
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBdaemon_forks_slaves\fP"
This parameter is only checked if
.B control_slaves
(see above) is set to TRUE
and thus Univa Grid Engine is the creator of the slave tasks of a parallel
application via
.M sge_execd 8
and
.M sge_shepherd 8 .
.PP
The
.B daemon_forks_slaves
parameter defines if every task of a tightly integrated parallel job gets started
individually via \fBqrsh -inherit\fP (default value FALSE, e.g. used for mpich integration)
or if a single daemon is started via \fBqrsh -inherit\fP on every slave host which
forks the slave tasks (value TRUE, e.g. used for openmpi or lam integration).
.PP
With
.B daemon_forks_slaves
set to TRUE only a single task (the daemon) may get started per slave host,
all limits set for this task are multiplied by the number of slots granted on the host.

.SS "\fBmaster_forks_slaves\fP"
The
.B master_forks_slaves
parameter can be set to TRUE if the master task (e.g. mpirun called in the job script)
starts tasks running on the master host via fork/exec instead of starting them via
\fBqrsh -inherit\fB.
.PP
With
.B master_forks_slaves
set to TRUE all limits set for the master task (the job script)
will be increased by the slave task limit multiplied by the number of slots granted on the host.
No further tasks can be started on the master host via \fBqrsh -inherit\fP.

.SH RESTRICTIONS
\fBNote\fP, that the functionality of the start-up, shutdown
and signaling procedures remains the full responsibility
of the administrator configuring the parallel environment.
Univa Grid Engine will just invoke these procedures and evaluate their
exit status. If the procedures do not perform their tasks
properly or if the parallel environment or the parallel
application behave unexpectedly, Univa Grid Engine has no means to detect
this.
