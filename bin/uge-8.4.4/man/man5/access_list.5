.\"
.SH NAME
access_list \- Univa Grid Engine access list file format
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Access lists are used in Univa Grid Engine to define access permissions of users
to the cluster via the global configuration (see
.M sge_conf 5 )
and job classes (see
.M sge_job_class 5 ).
They define
access permissions to hosts (see
.M host_conf 5 ),
queues (see
.M queue_conf 5 ),
parallel environments (see
.M sge_pe 5 ),
projects (see
.M project 5)
and they allow to define limits for multiple users via resource quotas (see
.M sge_resource_quota 5)
.PP
A list of currently configured 
access lists can be displayed via the
.M qconf 1
\fB\-sul\fP option. The contents of each enlisted access list can
be shown via the \fB\-su\fP switch. The output follows the
.I access_list
format description. New access lists can be created and existing can be
modified via the \fB\-au\fP and \fB\-du\fP options to
.M qconf 1 .
.PP
Departments are a special form of access list that additionally allow
assignment of functional shares and override tickets. 
.PP
Note, Univa Grid Engine allows backslashes (\\) be used to escape newline
(\\newline) characters. The backslash and the newline are replaced with a
space (" ") character before any interpretation.
.PP
There are several predefined access lists that gain access to certain functionalities 
of a Univa Grid Engine system:
.IP \fBarusers\fP
The access control list allows users that are referenced to submit and control 
advance reservations (see
.M qrsub 1 ).
.IP \fBdeadlineusers\fP
Users mentioned in this access control list can specify a deadline for jobs either
during the submission with
.M qsub 1
\fB-dl\fP or after submission with the 
.M qalter 1
\fB-dl\fP switch.
.IP \fBsessionusers\fP
GDI sessions have been introduced with Univa Grid Engine 8.2. Such objects can be 
created, modified and deleted by managers or users that are members of the
\fBsessionusers\fP access control list. The list will be defined during a default
installation of Univa Grid Engine but it will be empty. Either users can be added to give them permissions
to create, modify and deleted own session objects or the \fBsessionusers\fP 
access control list can be deleted to give all users permissions.
.IP \fBsudomasters\fP
see \fBsudoers\fP below.
.IP \fBsudoers\fP
\fBsudomasters\fP and \fBsudoers\fP access lists are used in combination with the 
Univa Grid Engine Rest Service. Users mentioned in 
\fBsudomasters\fP can trigger commands on behalf of different users that have to be
specified in \fBsudoers\fP so that corresponding Univa Grid Engine requests are accepted
and executed. This functionality is available since Univa Grid Engine 8.3.

.SH FORMAT
The following list of \fIaccess_list\fP parameters specifies the
.I access_list
content:
.SS "\fBname\fP"
The name of the access list as defined for \fIuserset_name\fP in
.M sge_types 1 .
.SS "\fBtype\fP"
The type of the access list, currently  one  of 
.I ACL,
or 
.I DEPT 
or a  combination of both in a comma separated list. Depending on this parameter  
the access list can be used as access list only or as a department. 
.SS "\fBoticket\fP"
The amount of override tickets currently assigned to the department.
.SS "\fBfshare\fP"
The current functional share of the department.
.SS "\fBentries\fP"
The entries parameter contains the comma separated list of 
those UNIX users (see \fIuser_name\fP in
.M sge_types 1 )
or those primary UNIX groups that are assigned to the access list 
or the department. By default only a user's primary UNIX group is used; secondary groups
are ignored as long as the \fIqmaster_param\fP \fBENABLE_SUP_GRP_EVAL\fP is not defined. 
Only symbolic names are allowed.  A group
is differentiated from a user name by prefixing the group name with a '@' sign. 
Pure access lists allow enlisting any user or group in any access list.  
.PP
When using departments, each user or group enlisted may only be enlisted 
in one department, in order to ensure a unique assignment of jobs to departments. 
To jobs whose users do not match with any of the users or groups enlisted under entries the 
.I defaultdepartment 
is assigned, if existing.
