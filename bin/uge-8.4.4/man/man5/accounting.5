.SH NAME
accounting \- Univa Grid Engine accounting file format
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
An accounting record is written to the Univa Grid Engine
accounting file for each job having finished. The accounting file is
processed by
.M qacct 1
to derive accounting statistics.
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
Each job is represented by a line in the accounting file. Empty lines
and lines which contain one character or less are ignored.
Accounting record entries are
separated by colon (':') signs. The entries denote in their order
of appearance:
.SS "\fBqname\fP"
Name of the cluster queue in which the job has run.
.SS "\fBhostname\fP"
Name of the execution host.
.SS "\fBgroup\fP"
The effective group id of the job owner when executing the job.
.SS "\fBowner\fP"
Owner of the Univa Grid Engine job.
.SS "\fBjob_name\fP"
Job name.
.SS "\fBjob_number\fP"
Job identifier - job number.
.SS "\fBaccount\fP"
An account string as specified by the
.M qsub 1
or
.M qalter 1
\fB\-A\fP option.
.SS "\fBpriority\fP"
Priority value assigned to the job corresponding to the \fBpriority\fP
parameter in the queue configuration (see
.M queue_conf 5 ).
.SS "\fBsubmission_time\fP"
Submission time (64bit GMT unix time stamp in milliseconds).
.SS "\fBstart_time\fP"
Start time (64bit GMT unix time stamp in milliseconds).
.SS "\fBend_time\fP"
End time (64bit GMT unix time stamp in milliseconds).
.SS "\fBfailed\fP"
Indicates the problem which occurred in case a job could not be started on 
the execution host (e.g. because the owner of the job did not have a valid 
account on that machine). If Univa Grid Engine tries to start a job multiple times, 
this may lead to multiple entries in the accounting file corresponding to 
the same job ID.
.SS "\fBexit_status\fP"
Exit status of the job script (or Univa Grid Engine specific status in case
of certain error conditions).
The exit status is determined by following the normal shell conventions.
If the command terminates normally the value of the command is its exit status.
However, in the case that the command exits abnormally, a value of 0200 (octal), 
128 (decimal) is added to the value of the command to make up the exit status.
.P
.RS
For example: If a job dies through signal 9 (SIGKILL) then the exit status 
becomes 128 + 9 = 137.
.RE
.SS "\fBru_wallclock\fP"
Difference between \fBend_time\fP and \fBstart_time\fP (see above).
.PP
The remainder of the accounting entries follows the contents of the
standard UNIX rusage structure as described in
.M getrusage 2 .
Depending on the operating system where the job was executed some of the
fields may be 0.  The following entries are provided:
.PP
.nf
.RS
.B ru_utime
.B ru_stime
.B ru_maxrss
.B ru_ixrss
.B ru_ismrss
.B ru_idrss
.B ru_isrss
.B ru_minflt
.B ru_majflt
.B ru_nswap
.B ru_inblock
.B ru_oublock
.B ru_msgsnd
.B ru_msgrcv
.B ru_nsignals
.B ru_nvcsw
.B ru_nivcsw
.RE

.PP

.SS "\fBproject\fP"
The project which was assigned to the job.
.SS "\fBdepartment\fP"
The department which was assigned to the job.
.SS "\fBgranted_pe\fP"
The parallel environment which was selected for that job.
.SS "\fBslots\fP"
The number of slots which were dispatched to the job by the scheduler.
.SS "\fBtask_number\fP"
Array job task index number.
.SS "\fBcpu\fP"
The cpu time usage in seconds.
.SS "\fBmem\fP"
The integral memory usage in Gbytes cpu seconds.
.SS "\fBio\fP"
The amount of data transferred in Gbytes.
On Linux data transferred means all bytes read and written by the job through the
read(), pread(), write() and pwrite() systems calls.
.SS "\fBcategory\fP"
A string specifying the job category.
.SS "\fBiow\fP"
The io wait time in seconds.
.SS "\fBioops\fP"
The number of io operations.
.SS "\fBpe_taskid\fP"
If this identifier is set the task was part of a parallel job and was
passed to Univa Grid Engine via the qrsh -inherit interface.
.SS "\fBmaxvmem\fP"
The maximum vmem size in bytes.
.SS "\fBarid\fP"
Advance reservation identifier. If the job used resources of an advance
reservation then this field contains a positive integer identifier otherwise the
value is "\fB0\fP" .
.SS "\fBar_submission_time\fP"
If the job used resources of an advance reservation then this field contains the submission time (64bit GMT unix time stamp in milliseconds) of the advance reservation, otherwise the value is "\fB0\fP" .
.SS "\fBjob_class\fP"
If the job has been running in a job class, the name of the job class, otherwise "\fBNONE\fP" .
.SS "\fBqdel_info\fP"
If the job (the array task) has been deleted via qdel, "\fB<username>@<hostname>\fP", else "\fBNONE\fP".
If qdel was called multiple times, every invocation is recorded in a comma separated list.
.SS "\fBmaxrss\fP"
The maximum resident set size in bytes.
.SS "\fBmaxpss\fP"
The maximum proportional set size in bytes.
.SS "\fBsubmit_host\fP"
The submit host name.
.SS "\fBcwd\fP"
The working directory the job ran in as specified with qsub / qalter switches -cwd and -wd.
As the delimiter used by the accounting file (colon ":") can be part of the working directory
all colons in the working directory are replaced by ASCII code 255.
.SS "\fBsubmit_cmd\fP"
The command line used for job submission.
As the delimiter used by the accounting file (colon ":") can be part of the command line
all colons in the command line are replaced by ASCII code 255.
Line feeds being part of the command line will be replaced by a space character.
The qacct client converts them back to colon.
For jobs submitted via the DRMAA interface or via qmon graphical user interface
the accounting file contains "NONE" as submit_cmd.
.SS "\fBwallclock\fP"
The wallclock time the job spent in running state.
Times during which the job was suspended are not counted as wallclock time.
For loosely integrated jobs and for tightly integrated jobs with accounting summary enabled
the wallclock time reported for the master task is the wallclock time multiplied by
the number of job slots.
