.TH PATH_MAP 5 "UGE 8.4.4" "Univa Grid Engine File Formats"
.\"
.SH NAME
path_map \- Univa Grid Engine path mapping file format
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I path_map
file is only necessary if a Windows (win-x86) host is part of the Univa Grid Engine cluster. It is used
to define how UNIX paths shall be converted into Windows paths.
.PP
The
.I path_map
file contains a list of comma separated mappings between UNIX and the corresponding Windows paths.
There are two columns in each line. In the left column, the UNIX path is listed, in the right column, the corresponding Windows path is listed. The columns are separated by a comma, which may be followed by a blank to improve readability.
.PP
The
.I path_map
file will be used only on Windows and by these Univa Grid Engine components:
.M sge_execd 8 ,
.M sge_shepherd 8 ,
.M uge_js_service.exe 8
and all Univa Grid Engine client commands.
.PP
If these Univa Grid Engine components have to convert a path, they will scan the left column of the
.I path_map
file from top to bottom until they find a path that matches the beginning of the path to convert.
This part will then be replaced by the Windows path from the right column of the same line. After
this, all slashes in the path to convert will be replaced by backslashes.
Because of this, it is not possible to use UNIX paths that contain backslashes for a Univa Grid Engine
cluster that includes a Windows host.
.PP
A proper
.I path_map
file always contains a mapping with the pseudo path "/execd_spool_dir/win-x86/placeholder" in the
left column. The same path appears in the configuration of a Windows execution host. It is
just a placeholder that is necessary because it's not possible to configure Windows paths
in the global or execution host configuration.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
If the path to convert is "/home/jdoe/joboutputs/myjob.o17" and the path_map file looks like this:
.PP
/opt/UGE820, \\\\server\\share\\UGE820
.br
/execd_spool_dir/win-x86/placeholder, c:\\tmp\\spool\\UGE
.br
/var/sgeCA, c:\\tmp\\var\\sgeCA
.br
/home, \\\\homeserver\\homeshare
.br
/tmp, c:\\tmp
.PP
then Univa Grid Engine will scan over the lines in the
.I path_map
file until it finds in the left column a path that matches the beginning of the path to convert. In this case, this is the path "/home". It will be replaced in the path to convert by the content of the right column, resulting in the intermediate path "\\\\homeserver\\homeshare/jdoe/joboutputs/myjob.o17". Then, all slashes in the path are replaced by backslashes, resulting in the final path "\\\\homeserver\\homeshare\\jdoe\\joboutputs\\myjob.o17".
