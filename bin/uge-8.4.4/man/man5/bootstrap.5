.TH BOOTSTRAP 5 "UGE 8.4.4" "Univa Grid Engine File Formats"
.\"
.SH NAME
bootstrap \- Univa Grid Engine bootstrap file
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I bootstrap
contains parameters that are needed for the startup of Univa Grid Engine components.
It is created during the sge_qmaster installation.
Modifying
.I bootstrap
in a running system is not supported.
.PP
.\"
.SH FORMAT
.\"
The paragraphs that follow provide brief descriptions of the individual
parameters that compose the bootstrap configuration for a
Univa Grid Engine cluster:
.\"
.SS "\fBadmin_user\fP"
Administrative user account used by Univa Grid Engine for all internal file
handling (status spooling, message logging, etc.). Can be used in cases
where the root account does not have the corresponding file access
permissions (e.g. on a shared file system without global root read/write
access).
.PP
Being a parameter set at installation time changing \fBadmin_user\fP in
a running system is not supported. Changing it manually on a shut-down cluster
is possible, but if access to the Univa Grid Engine spooling area is interrupted, 
this will result in unpredictable behavior.

The \fBadmin_user\fP parameter has no default value, but instead it is
defined during the master installation procedure.
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBdefault_domain\fP"
Only needed if your Univa Grid Engine cluster covers hosts belonging to more than
a single DNS domain. In this case it can be used if your hostname resolving 
yields both qualified and unqualified hostnames for the hosts in one of the 
DNS domains. 
The value of
.B default_domain
is appended to the unqualified hostname to define a fully qualified hostname.
The 
.B default_domain
parameter will have no effect if 
.B ignore_fqdn
is set to "true".
.sp 1
Being a parameter set at installation time changing
.B default_domain
in a running system is not supported. The default for
.B default_domain
is "none", in which case it will not be used.
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBignore_fqdn\fP"
Ignore fully qualified domain name component of hostnames. Should be set 
if all hosts belonging to a Univa Grid Engine cluster are part of a single DNS 
domain. It is switched on if set to either "true" or "1". Switching it 
on may solve problems with load reports due to different hostname 
resolutions across the cluster.
.sp 1
Being a parameter set at installation time changing
.B ignore_fqdn
in a running system is not supported. The default for
.B ignore_fqdn
is "true".
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBspooling_method\fP"
Defines how
.M sge_qmaster 8
writes its configuration and the status information of a running cluster.
.PP
The available spooling methods are \fIberkeleydb\fP, \fIpostgres\fP and \fIclassic\fP.
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBspooling_lib\fP"
The name of a shared library containing the \fBspooling_method\fP to be loaded at
.M sge_qmaster 8
initialization time.
The extension characterizing a shared library (.so, .sl, .dylib etc.) is not contained in \fBspooling_lib\fP.
.PP
If \fBspooling_method\fP was set to \fIberkeleydb\fP during installation, \fBspooling_lib\fP is set to \fIlibspoolb\fP,
if \fIpostgres\fP was chosen as \fBspooling_method\fP, \fBspooling_lib\fP is set to \fIlibspoolp\fP,
if \fIclassic\fP was chosen as \fBspooling_method\fP, \fBspooling_lib\fP is set to \fIlibspoolc\fP.
.PP
Not all operating systems allow the dynamic loading of libraries. On these
platforms a certain spooling method (default: berkeleydb) is compiled into the binaries and the
parameter \fBspooling_lib\fP will be ignored.
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBspooling_params\fP"
Defines parameters to the chosen spooling method.
.PP
Parameters that are needed to initialize the spooling framework, e.g. to open database files or to connect to a certain database server.
.PP
The spooling parameters value for spooling method \fIberkeleydb\fP is the path to the database directory, e.g. /sge_local/default/spool/qmaster/spooldb for spooling to a local filesystem.
.PP
For spooling method \fIpostgres\fP the spooling parameters contain the PostgreSQL connection string in Keyword/Value format documented at
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/interactive/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING.
.PP
For spooling method \fIclassic\fP the spooling parameters take the form
<common_dir>;<qmaster spool dir>, e.g.
/sge/default/common;/sge/default/spool/qmaster
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBbinary_path\fP"
The directory path where the Univa Grid Engine binaries reside. It is used within
Univa Grid Engine components to locate and startup other Univa Grid Engine programs.
.PP
The path name given here is searched for binaries as well as any directory
below with a directory name equal to the current operating system
architecture. Therefore, /usr/SGE/bin will work for all architectures,
if the corresponding binaries are located in subdirectories named aix43,
lx-amd64, lx-x86, hp11, hp11-64, sol-amd64, sol-sparc etc.
.PP
The default location for the binary path is
<sge_root>/bin
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBqmaster_spool_dir\fP"
The location where the master spool directory resides. Only the
.M sge_qmaster 8
and 
.M sge_shadowd 8
need to have access to this directory. 
The master spool directory \- in particular the job_scripts
directory and the messages
log file \- may become quite large depending on the size of the
cluster and the number of jobs. Be sure to allocate enough disk space
and regularly clean off the log files, e.g. via a
.M cron 8
job.
.PP
Being a parameter set at installation time changing \fBqmaster_spool_dir\fP
in a running system is not supported.
.PP
The default location for the
master spool directory is <sge_root>/<cell>/spool/qmaster.
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBsecurity_mode\fP"
The security mode defines the set of security features the installed cluster is using.
.PP
Possible security mode settings are none, afs, dce, kerberos, csp.
(no additional security, AFS, DCE, KERBEROS, CSP security model).
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBlistener_threads\fP"
The default for this parameter will be set to 2 during installation process.
.PP
Listener threads are threads that do preliminary work for worker and reader 
threads running in
.M sge_qmaster 8 .
At least two of them are required in a system.
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBworker_threads\fP"
The default for this parameter will be set to 4 during installation process.
.PP
Defines the number of worker threads that are started during 
.M sge_qmaster 8
start. It is not possible to disable the worker thread pool and the number of 
threads part of that pool cannot be adjusted dynamically. The change of this
parameter requires a restart of 
.M sge_qmaster 8 .
.PP
The recommended value for this parameter is 4. If no server JSV is configured 
then it is possible to reduce the value to 2 without performance loss. 
Starting more than 4 threads will not improve
.M sge_qmaster 8
scheduling and execution performance. 
In rare cases more than 4 threads might improve the cluster submit rate if
a server JSV is configured that needs much time to verify one job.
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBreader_threads\fP"
The default for this parameter will be set during installation process.
.PP
The value 0 means that the reader thread pool is completely disabled in the
.M sge_qmaster 8
process. If the reader thread pool is disabled then all read-only and read-write 
requests will be handled by the worker threads.
.PP
Values between 1 and 64 will enable the reader thread pool. The corresponding 
number of reader threads will be part of the initially created read-only thread 
pool when
.M sge_qmaster 8
is started. This thread pool will then handle incoming read-only requests whereas 
worker threads will then handle read-write requests only. 
.PP
During runtime it is not possible to enable/disable the reader thread pool. To do so
it is required to adjust the bootstrap parameter and to restart
.M sge_qmaster 8 .
.PP
In systems where the reader thread pool is enabled it is possible to dynamically adjust
the number of reader threads. The 
.M qconf 1
-at/-kt switches can be used to start/stop reader threads but any attempt to terminate
the last 2 reader threads will be rejected as well as the attempt to start more that 
64 threads.
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBscheduler_threads\fP"
The number of scheduler threads (allowed: 0-1, default set by installation: 1, off: 0).
(see 
.M qconf 1
-kt/-at option)
.\"
.\"
.SS "\fBjvm_threads\fP"
The number of JVM threads (allowed: 0-1, default set by installation, off: 0).
