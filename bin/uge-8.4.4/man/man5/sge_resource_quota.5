.SH NAME
SGE_resource_quota \- Univa Grid Engine resource quota file format
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Resource quota sets (RQSs) are a flexible way to set the maximum resource consumption for any job requests.
They are used by the scheduler to select the next possible jobs to run.
The job request distinction is done by a set of user, project, cluster queue, host, PE and job class filter criteria.
.PP
By using resource quota sets, administrators are allowed to define a fine-grained resource quota
configuration. This helps restrict some job requests to lesser resource usage, and grants
other job requests a higher resource usage.
.sp 1
Note: Jobs requesting an Advance Reservation (AR) are not honored by Resource Quotas,
not subject to the resulting limit, and not debited in the usage consumption.
.PP
The list of currently configured RQSs can be displayed via the
.M qconf 1
\fB\-srqsl\fP option. The contents of each listed RQS definition
can be shown via the \fB\-srqs\fP option. The output follows the
.I  SGE_resource_quota
format description.
Resource quota sets can be created, modified and deleted via
the \fB\-arqs\fP, \fB\-mrqs\fP and \fB\-drqs\fP options to
.M qconf 1 .
.PP
A resource quota set defines a maximum resource quota for a particular job request. All of the
configured rule sets apply all of the time. This means that if multiple resource quota sets
are defined, the most restrictive set is used.
.PP
Every resource quota set consists of one or more resource quota rules. These rules are evaluated
in order, and the first rule that matches a specific request will be used. A resource quota
set always results in at most one effective resource quota rule for a specific request.
.PP
Note, Univa Grid Engine allows backslashes (\\) be used to escape newline
(\\newline) characters. The backslash and the newline are replaced with a
space (" ") character before any interpretation.

.SH FORMAT
A resource quota set definition contains the following parameters:
.SS "\fBname\fP"
The resource quota set name.
.SS "\fBenabled\fP"
If set to \fItrue\fP the resource quota set is active and will be considered
for scheduling decisions. The default value is \fIfalse\fP.
.SS "\fBdescription\fP"
This description field is optional and can be set to an arbitrary string. The
default value is \fINONE\fP.
.SS "\fBlimit\fP"
Every resource quota set needs at least one resource quota rule definition started by
the limit field. It's possible to define more resource quota rules divided by a new line.
A resource quota rule consists of an optional name, the filters for a specific job
request and the resource quota limit.
.PP
By default, the expressed limit counts for the entire filter scope. To express a
filter-scope-specific limit, it's possible to define an expanded list by setting the list
between '{' and '}'. It's only possible to set one complete filter in an expanded list.
.\"
The tags for expressing a resource quota rule are:
.IP "name"
The name of the rule. The use is optional. The rule name must be unique in one
resource quota set.
.IP "users"
Contains a comma-separated list of UNIX users or ACLs (see
.M access_list 5 ).
This parameter filters for jobs by a user in the list or one of the ACLs
in the list. Any user not in the list will not be considered for the resource quota
rule. The default value is '*', which means any user. An ACL is differentiated
from a UNIX user name by prefixing the ACL name with an '@' sign. To exclude a
user or ACL from the rule, the name can be prefixed with the '!' sign. Defined
UNIX user or ACL names need not be known in the Univa Grid Engine configuration.
.IP "projects"
Contains a comma-separated list of projects (see
.M project 5 ).
This parameter filters for jobs requesting a project in the list. Any
project not in the list will not be considered for the resource quota rule.
If no "projects" filter is specified, all projects and jobs with no requested project
match the rule. The value '*' means all jobs with requested projects. To
exclude a project from the rule, the name can be prefixed with the '!' sign.
The value '!*' means only jobs with no project requested.
.IP "pes"
Contains a comma-separated list of PEs (see
.M sge_pe 5 ).
This parameter filters for jobs requesting a PE in the list. Any PE not in
the list will not be considered for the resource quota rule. If no "pes" filter is
specified, all PEs and jobs with no requested PE match the rule. The value '*'
means all jobs with requested PEs. To exclude a PE from the rule, the name can
be prefixed with the '!' sign. The value '!*' means only jobs with no PE
requested.
.IP "jcs"
Contains a comma-separated list of job class or job class variant names (see
.M sge_job_class 5 
and \fBjc_list\fP in
.M sge_types 1 ).
This parameter filters for jobs requesting a job class variant in the list. 
If the variant part of a name is omitted then the \fBdefault\fP variant is used
as the filter. Any job class not in the list will not be considered for the 
resource quota rule. If no "jcs" filter is specified, all variants of all job 
classes and jobs with no job class specification match the rule. 
To exclude a job class variant from the rule, the name can be prefixed 
with the exclamation mark (!). '!*' means only jobs that were not derived from a 
job class.
.IP "queues"
Contains a comma-separated list of cluster queues (see
.M queue_conf 5 ).
This parameter filters for jobs that may be scheduled in a queue in the list.
Any queue not in the list will not be considered for the resource quota rule. The
default value is '*', which means any queue. To exclude a queue from the rule,
the name can be prefixed with the '!' sign.
.IP "hosts"
Contains a comma-separated list of host or hostgroups (see
.M host 5
and
.M hostgroup 5 ).
This parameter filters for jobs that may be scheduled in a host in the list or a
host contained in a hostgroup in the list. Any host not in the list will not be considered
for the resource quota rule. The default value is '*', which means any hosts.
To exclude a host or hostgroup from the rule, the name can be prefixed with the '!' sign.
.IP "to"
This mandatory field defines the quota for resource attributes for this rule.
The quota is expressed by one or more limit definitions, separated by commas.
There are two kinds of limit definitions:
.RS
.IP "static limits"
Static limits set static values as quotas. Each limit consists of a complex
attribute followed by an "=" sign and the value specification compliant with
the complex attribute type (see
.M complex 5 ).
.IP "dynamic limits"
A dynamic limit is a simple algebraic expression used to derive the limit
value. To be dynamic, the formula can reference a complex attribute whose
value is used for the calculation of the resulting limit.
The formula expression syntax is that of
a sum of weighted complex values, that is:
.sp 1
.nf
{w1|$complex1[*w1]}[{+|-}{w2|$complex2[*w2]}[{+|-}...]]
.fi
.sp 1
The weighting factors (w1, ...) are positive integers or floating point numbers
in double precision. The complex values (complex1, ...)
are specified by the name defined as type INT or DOUBLE in the complex list
(see
.M complex 5 ).
.br
.B Note:
Dynamic limits can only configured for a host-specific rule.
.RE
.PP
Please note that resource quotas are not enforced as job resource limits.
Limiting for example h_vmem in a resource quota set does not result in a
memory limit being set for job execution.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following is the simplest form of a resource quota set. It restricts all
users together to the maximal use of 100 slots in the whole cluster.
.nf

=======================================================================
{
   name         max_u_slots
   description  "All users max use of 100 slots"
   enabled      true
   limit        to slots=100
}
=======================================================================

.fi
.sp 1
The next example restricts user1 and user2 to 6g virtual_free
and all other users to the maximal use of 4g virtual_free on
every host in hostgroup lx_hosts.
.nf

=======================================================================
{
   name         max_virtual_free_on_lx_hosts
   description  "resource quota for virtual_free restriction"
   enabled      true
   limit        users {user1,user2} hosts {@lx_host} to virtual_free=6g
   limit        users {*} hosts {@lx_host} to virtual_free=4g
}
=======================================================================

.fi
.sp 1
The next example shows the use of a dynamic limit.
It restricts all users together to a maximum use of double the size of num_proc.
.nf

=======================================================================
{
   name         max_slots_on_every_host
   enabled      true
   limit        hosts {*} to slots=$num_proc*2
}
=======================================================================
