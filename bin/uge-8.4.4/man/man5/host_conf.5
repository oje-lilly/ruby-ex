.SH NAME
host_conf \- Univa Grid Engine execution host configuration file format
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Host_conf
reflects the format of the template file for the execution host configuration.
Via the \fB\-ae\fP and \fB\-me\fP options of the
.M qconf 1
command, you can add execution hosts and modify the configuration of
any execution host in the cluster. Default execution host entries are added
automatically as soon as a
.M sge_execd 8
registers to
.M sge_qmaster 8
for the very first time from a certain host. The
.M qconf 1
\fB\-sel\fP switch can be used to display a list of execution host being
currently configured in your Univa Grid Engine system. Via the \fB\-se\fP
option you can print the execution host configuration of a
specified host.
.PP
The special hostname "global" can be used to define cluster global 
characteristics.
.PP
Note, Univa Grid Engine allows backslashes (\\) be used to escape newline
(\\newline) characters. The backslash and the newline are replaced with a
space (" ") character before any interpretation.

.SH FORMAT
The format of a
.I host_conf
file is defined as follows:
.SS "\fBhostname\fP"
The execution hosts name as defined for \fIhost_name\fP in
.M sge_types 1 .
.SS "\fBload_scaling\fP"
A comma separated list of scaling values to be applied to each or part
of the load values being reported by the
.M sge_execd 8
on the host and being defined in the complex configuration
(see
.M complex 5 ).
The load scaling factors are intended to level hardware or operating
system specific differences between execution hosts. 
.sp 1
The syntax of a load factor specification is as follows: First the name of
the load value (as defined in the complex) is given and, separated
by an equal sign, the load scaling value is provided. No blanks are
allowed in between the load_scaling value string.
.sp 1
The parameter
.B load_scaling
is not meaningful for the definition of the "global" host.
.SS "\fBcomplex_values\fP"
.B complex_values
defines quotas for resource attributes managed via this 
host. Each complex attribute is followed by an "=" sign and the value 
specification compliant with the complex attribute type (see
.M complex 5 ). 
Quota specifications are separated by commas. 
.sp 1
The quotas are related to the resource consumption of all jobs on a host in 
the case of consumable resources (see
.M complex 5
for details on 
consumable resources) or they are interpreted on a per job slot basis in the
case of non-consumable resources. Consumable resource attributes are
commonly used to manage free memory, free disk space, available
floating software licenses, or access to specific co-processor devices,
while non-consumable attributes usually define distinctive characteristics
like type of hardware installed.
.sp 1
For consumable resource attributes an available resource amount is 
determined by subtracting the current resource consumption of all 
running jobs on the host from the quota in the
.B complex_values
list. Jobs can only be dispatched to a host if no resource requests exceed any
corresponding resource availability obtained by this scheme. The quota definition in the 
.B complex_values
list is automatically replaced by the current load value
reported for this attribute, if load is monitored for this resource and if the
reported load value is more stringent than the quota. This effectively
avoids oversubscription of resources.
.sp 1
A special configuration is needed for resources with type RSMAP (see
.M complex 5).
A RSMAP complex is initialized in the
.B complex_values
field not just only by the amount of instances available on the host,
also a list of strings must be appended in parentheses (like idlist=2(id1 id2)).
If the scheduler assigns a specific amount of those consumables to the jobs,
it also maps that amount of ids to the job. The ids are chosen in the order
they are configured in the list. The assigned ids can be seen in
the qstat -j output. The job has set an environment variable SGE_HGR_<name>=<idlist>,
in order to determine, which ids where selected. This is particular useful
for devices, where a job needs an access key for (like for co-processors) in
order to avoid access collisions by jobs. Within the environment variable
identifier (<name>) only shell compatible characters are printed ([a-z|A-Z|_|0-9]*),
other characters are omitted.
.sp 1
RSMAP id lists can also be enhanced with a topology mask on hosts, which are
supported by the core binding feature. Then additionally to the id selection
(which is always in order of the configured values), the job is bound to the
cores, which are marked as available in the topology mask. The topology mask
is only available for per HOST complexes (see
.M complex 5)
and appended to each id by a colon. Example: complex_values GPU=2(GPU0:SccCC GPU1:SCCcc).
When the job requests -l GPU=1 and the scheduler select GPU0, then the job
gets bound to the third and fourth core of the host. If the GPU1 is selected, the
job is automatically bound to the first and second core of the execution host.
.sp 1
.B Note:
Load values replacing the quota specifications may have become 
more stringent because they have been scaled (see
.B load_scaling
above) and/or
load adjusted (see
.M sched_conf 5 ).
The \fI\-F\fP option of
.M qstat 1
and the load display in the
.M qmon 1
queue control dialog (activated by 
clicking on a queue icon while the "Shift" key is pressed) provide 
detailed information on the actual availability of consumable 
resources and on the origin of the values taken into account currently.
.sp 1
.B Note also:
The resource consumption of running jobs (used for the availability 
calculation) as well as the resource requests of the jobs waiting to be 
dispatched either may be derived from explicit user requests during 
job submission (see the \fI\-l\fP option to
.M qsub 1 )
or from a "default" value 
configured for an attribute by the administrator (see
.M complex 5 ).
The \fI\-r\fP option to
.M qstat 1
can be used for retrieving full detail on the actual 
resource requests of all jobs in the system.
.sp 1
For non-consumable resources Univa Grid Engine simply compares the 
job's attribute requests with the corresponding specification in 
.B complex_values
taking the relation operator of the complex attribute 
definition into account (see
.M complex 5 ).
If the result of the comparison is 
"true", the host is suitable for the job with respect to the particular 
attribute. For parallel jobs each job slot to be occupied by a parallel task is 
meant to provide the same resource attribute value.
.sp 1
.B Note:
Only numeric complex attributes can be defined as consumable 
resources and hence non-numeric attributes are always handled on a 
per job slot basis.
.sp 1
The default value for this parameter is NONE, i.e. no administrator 
defined resource attribute quotas are associated with the host.
.SS "\fBload_values\fP"
This entry cannot be configured but is only displayed in case of a
.M qconf 1
\fB\-se\fP command. All load values are displayed as reported by the
.M sge_execd 8
on the host. The load values are enlisted in a comma separated list. Each
load value start with its name, followed by an equal sign and the reported
value.
.SS "\fBprocessors\fP"
.B Note:
Deprecated, may be removed in future release.
.br
This entry cannot be configured but is only displayed in case of a
.M qconf 1
\fB\-se\fP command. Its value is the number of processors which has been
detected by
.M sge_execd 8
on the corresponding host.
.SS "\fBusage_scaling\fP"
The format is equivalent to
.B load_scaling
(see above), the only valid attributes to be scaled however are
.B cpu
for CPU time consumption,
.B mem 
for Memory consumption aggregated over the life-time of jobs and
.B io
for data transferred via any I/O devices. The default NONE means
"no scaling", i.e. all scaling factors are 1.
.SS "\fBuser_lists\fP"
The \fBuser_lists\fP parameter contains a comma separated list of so called
user access lists as described in
.M access_list 5 .
Each user contained in at least one of the enlisted access lists has
access to the host. If the \fBuser_lists\fP parameter is set to
NONE (the default) any user has access being not explicitly excluded
via the \fBxuser_lists\fP parameter described below.
If a user is contained both in an access list enlisted in \fBxuser_lists\fP
and \fBuser_lists\fP the user is denied access to the host.
.SS "\fBxuser_lists\fP"
The \fBxuser_lists\fP parameter contains a comma separated list of so called
user access lists as described in
.M access_list 5 .
Each user contained in at least one of the enlisted access lists is not
allowed to access the host. If the \fBxuser_lists\fP parameter is set to
NONE (the default) any user has access.
If a user is contained both in an access list enlisted in \fBxuser_lists\fP
and \fBuser_lists\fP the user is denied access to the host.
.SS "\fBprojects\fP"
The \fBprojects\fP parameter contains a comma separated list of projects
that have access to the host. Any projects not in this list are denied
access to the host. If set to NONE (the default), any project
has access that is not specifically excluded via the \fBxprojects\fP
parameter described below. If a project is in both the \fBprojects\fP and
\fBxprojects\fP parameters, the project is denied access to the host.
.SS "\fBxprojects\fP"
The \fBxprojects\fP parameter contains a comma separated list of projects
that are denied access to the host. If set to NONE (the default), no
projects are denied access other than those denied access based on the
\fBprojects\fP parameter described above.  If a project is in both the
\fBprojects\fP and \fBxprojects\fP parameters, the project is denied
access to the host.
.\"
.SS "\fBreport_variables\fP"
The \fBreport_variables\fP parameter contains a comma separated list of 
variables that shall be written to the reporting file.
The variables listed here will be written to the reporting file when a load report arrives from an execution host.
.sp 1
Default settings can be done in the global host. Host specific settings for 
report_variables will override settings from the global host.
.SS "\fBlicense_constraints\fP"
The \fBlicense_constraints\fP parameter contains a comma separated list of
constraints that limits the usage of the given licenses. 
These constraints are inherited from License Orchestrator and cannot be 
changed locally in UGE. A license constraint shows to which License Manager 
a license belongs to as also the used and total count. Optionally it can 
express that licenses are limited to special users and/or to hosts.
For more information have a look at the License Orchestrator documentation.
.SS "\fBlicense_oversubscription\fP"
The \fBlicense_oversubscription\fP parameter contains a comma separated list of 
licenses whose reported load values are supposed to get increased.
Each license attribute is followed by an "=" sign and the count which should get 
added to the reported load value. The load value only gets increase when the 
reported value is 0 and not all of this licenses are consumed by this cluster.
