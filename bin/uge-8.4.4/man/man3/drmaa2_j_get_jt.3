A DRMAA2 job is submitted with a \fBdrmaa2_jtemplate\fR object, which describes the characteristics of the job (job name, command, parameter, resource selection etc\.)\. This function returns a deep copy of the job template used for job submission\. It is not available for jobs not submitted with DRMAA2, or after closing all DRMAA2 sessions (even when a session is reopened later)\. If the job session is closed the job templated is reaped internally only when the monitoring session is closed as well otherwise it stays in memory until the monitoring session is closed, too\.
.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Returns a newly allocated job template which was used for submitting the job\. It must be freed from the caller\. In case of an error NULL is returned and the error id and error message is set in the context of the calling thread\.
