.SH DESCRIPTION

.I Qsub
submits batch jobs to the Univa Grid Engine queuing system. Univa Grid Engine supports
single- and multiple-node jobs. \fBCommand\fP can be a path to a
binary or a script (see \fB-b\fP below) which contains the commands to be
run by the job using a shell (for example,
.M sh 1
or
.M csh 1 ).
Arguments to the command are given as \fBcommand_args\fP to
.I qsub .
If \fBcommand\fP is handled as a script then it is possible to embed flags
in the script.  If the first two characters of a script line either
match '#$' or are equal to the prefix string defined with the \fB-C\fP option
described below, the line is parsed for embedded command flags.
.PP
.I Qsh
submits an interactive X-windows session to Univa Grid Engine. An
.M xterm 1
is brought up from the executing machine with the display directed either to
the X-server indicated by the DISPLAY environment variable or as specified
with the \fI\-display qsh\fP option. Interactive jobs are not spooled if no
resource is
available to execute them. They are either dispatched to a suitable machine
for execution immediately or the user submitting the job is notified by
.I qsh
that appropriate resources to execute the job are not available.
\fBxterm_args\fP are passed to the
.M xterm 1
executable.  Note, however, that the \fI\-e\fP and \fI\-ls\fP xterm options
do not work with
.I qsh .
.PP
.I Qlogin
is similar to
.I qsh
in that it submits an interactive job
to the queuing system. It does not open an
.M xterm 1
window on the
X display, but uses the current terminal for user I/O. Usually,
.I qlogin
establishes a
.M telnet 1
connection with the remote host, using
standard client- and server-side commands. These commands can
be configured with the \fBqlogin_daemon\fP (server-side,
Univa Grid Engine
.I telnetd
if not set, otherwise something
like /usr/sbin/in.telnetd) and \fBqlogin_command\fP (client-side,
Univa Grid Engine
.I telnet
if not set, otherwise
something like /usr/bin/telnet) parameters in the global and
local configuration settings of
.M sge_conf 5 .
The client side command is automatically
parameterized with the remote host name and port number to which to
connect, resulting in an invocation like
.IP
/usr/bin/telnet my_exec_host 2442
.PP
for example.
.I Qlogin
is invoked exactly like
.I qsh
and its jobs can only run on INTERACTIVE queues.
.I Qlogin
jobs can only be used if the
.M sge_execd 8
is running under the root account.
.PP
.I Qrsh
is similar to 
.I qlogin
in that it submits an interactive job to the queuing system. 
It uses the current terminal for user I/O. 
Usually,
.I qrsh 
establishes a 
.M rsh 1
connection with the remote host. If no command is given to \fIqrsh\fP, an 
.M rlogin 1
session is established. It inherits all SGE_ environment variables plus SHELL,
HOME, TERM, LOGNAME, TZ, HZ, PATH and LANG.
The server-side commands used can be configured 
with the \fBrsh_daemon\fP and \fBrlogin_daemon\fP
parameters in the global and local configuration settings of 
.M sge_conf 5 .
An Univa Grid Engine
.I rshd
or
.I rlogind
is used if the parameters are not set. If the parameters are set, they should be
set to something like /usr/sbin/in.rshd or /usr/sbin/in.rlogind.
On the client-side, the \fBrsh_command\fP and \fBrlogin_command\fP parameters
can be set in the global and local configuration settings of 
.M sge_conf 5 . 
If they are not set, special Univa Grid Engine
.M rsh 1
and
.M rlogin 1
binaries delivered with Univa Grid Engine are used.
Use the cluster configuration parameters to integrate mechanisms like
.I ssh
or the
.M rsh 1
and
.M rlogin 1
facilities supplied with the operating system.
.PP
.I Qrsh
jobs can only run in INTERACTIVE queues unless the option \fB-now no\fP is
used (see below).
They can also only be run, if the 
.M sge_execd 8
is running under the root account.
.PP
.I Qrsh
provides an additional useful feature for integrating with
interactive tools providing a specific command shell. If the environment
variable
.B QRSH_WRAPPER
is set when
.I qrsh
is invoked, the command interpreter pointed to by
.B QRSH_WRAPPER
will be executed to run
.I qrsh
commands instead of the users login shell or any shell specified in the
.I qrsh
command-line.
The options \fB-cwd\fP,  \fB-v\fP,  \fB-V\fP,  and \fB-display\fP only 
apply to batch jobs.
.PP
.I Qalter
can be used to change the attributes of pending jobs. For array jobs
with a mix of running and pending tasks
(see the \fB\-t\fP option below), modification with
.I qalter
only affects the pending tasks.
.I Qalter
can change most of the 
characteristics of a job (see the corresponding statements in the OPTIONS 
section below), including those which were defined as embedded flags in the 
script file (see above).  Some submit options, such as the job script, cannot
be changed with
.I qalter.
.PP
.I Qresub
allows the user to create jobs as copies of existing pending or running
jobs. The copied jobs will have exactly the same attributes as the ones
from which they were copied, except with a new job ID and with a cleared
hold state. The only modification to
the copied jobs supported by
.I qresub
is assignment of a new hold state with the
\fB\-h\fP option. This option can be used to first copy a job and then change
its attributes via \fIqalter\fP.
.PP
Only a manager can use
.I qresub
on jobs submitted by another user.  Regular users can only use
.I qresub
on their own jobs.
.PP
For \fIqsub\fP, \fIqsh\fP, \fIqrsh\fP, and \fIqlogin\fP
the administrator and the user may define
default request files (see
.M sge_request 5 )
which can contain any of the
options described below.
If an option in a default request file is understood by
.I qsub
and
.I qlogin
but not by
.I qsh
the option is silently ignored if
.I qsh
is invoked. Thus you can 
maintain shared default request files for both
.I qsub
and \fIqsh\fP.
.PP
A cluster wide default request file
may be placed under $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sge_request.
User private default request files are processed under the
locations $HOME/.sge_request and $cwd/.sge_request. The working
directory local default request file has the highest precedence,
then the home directory located file and then the cluster global
file.
The option arguments, the embedded script flags and the options
in the default request files are
processed in the following order:
.PP
.RS
.nf
left to right in the script line,
left to right in the default request files,
from top to bottom of the script file (\fIqsub\fP only),
from top to bottom of default request files,
from left to right of the command line.
.fi
.RE
.PP
In other words, the command line can be used to override
the embedded flags and the default request settings.
The embedded flags, however, will override the default
settings.
.PP
\fBNote\fP, that the
.I -clear
option can be used to discard any previous settings at any
time in a default request file, in the embedded script flags, or
in a
command-line option. It is, however, not available with \fIqalter\fP.
.PP
The
options described below can be requested either hard or soft.
By default, all requests are considered hard until the \fB\-soft\fP option (see
below) is encountered. The hard/soft status remains in effect
until its counterpart is encountered again.
If all the hard requests for a job cannot 
be met, the job will not be scheduled.
Jobs which cannot be run at the present time
remain spooled.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-@ optionfile\fP"
Forces
\fIqsub\fP, \fIqrsh\fP, \fIqsh\fP, or \fIqlogin\fP
to use the
options contained in \fBoptionfile\fP. The indicated 
file may contain all valid
options. Comment lines must start with a "#" sign.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-a date_time\fP"
Available for \fIqsub\fP and \fIqalter\fP only.
.sp 1
Defines or redefines the time and date at which a job is eligible for 
execution. \fBDate_time\fP conforms to [[CC]]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS], for the 
details, please see \fBdate_time\fP in
.M sge_types 1 .
.sp 1
If this option is used with \fIqsub\fP or if a corresponding value is
specified in \fIqmon\fP then a parameter named \fBa\fP with the format 
CCYYMMDDhhmm.SS will be passed to the defined JSV instances
(see \fB\-jsv\fP option below or find more information concerning JSV in
.M jsv 1 ).
.\"
.IP "\fB\-ac variable[=value],...\fP"
Available for \fIqsub\fP, \fIqsh\fP, \fIqrsh\fP, \fIqlogin\fP and
\fIqalter\fP only.
.sp 1
Adds the given name/value pair(s) to the job's context. \fBValue\fP may be
omitted. Univa Grid Engine appends the given argument to the list of context
variables for the job. Multiple \fB\-ac\fP, \fB\-dc\fP, and \fB\-sc\fP options 
may be given. The order is important here. The variable name must not start
with the letters "+", "-" or "=".
.sp 1
The outcome of the evaluation of all \fB\-ac\fP, \fB\-dc\fP, and \fB\-sc\fP 
options is passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the name \fB\aac\fP.
(see \fB\-jsv\fP option below or find more information concerning JSV in
.M jsv 1 ).
.SP 1
.I QALTER
allows changing this option even while the job executes.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-adds parameter key value\fP"
Available for \fIqsub\fP, \fIqrsh\fP and \fIqalter\fP of Univa Grid Engine only.
.sp 1
Gives the user the possibility to add additional entries to list based 
job parameters like resource requests, job context, environment variables and more.
The \fB\-mods\fP and \fB\-clears\fP switches can be used to modify or remove a single 
entry of a job parameter list.
.sp 1
The parameter argument specifies the job parameter that should be enhanced.
The names used here are names of command line switches that are also used
in job classes or JSV to address job parameters. Currently the \fB\-adds\fP
switch supports following parameters: \fBac\fP, \fBCMDARG\fP, \fBcwd\fP, \fBe\fP, 
\fBhold_jid\fP, \fBi\fP, \fBl_hard\fP, \fBl_soft\fP, \fBM\fP, \fBmasterq\fP, 
\fBo\fP, \fBq_hard\fP, \fBq_hard\fP, \fBrou\fP, \fBS\fP and \fBv\fP.
The same set of parameters is also supported by the \fB\-mods\fP and \fB\-clears\fP
switches. The \fB\-clearp\fP switch allows to reset all list based parameters mentioned above 
and also non-list based parameters. Find corresponding non-list based parameter 
names in the \fB\-clearp\fP section below.
.sp 1
Please note that the \fBcwd\fP parameter is a list-based parameter that
can be addressed with the \fB\-adds\fP, \fB\-mods\fP and \fB\-clears\fP switches
although this list can only have one entry.
.sp 1
The key argument depends on the used parameter argument. For the \fBac\fP and \fBv\fP 
parameter it has to specify the name of a variable that should either be 
added to the job context or environment variable list. 
For the parameters \fBo\fP, \fBi\fP, \fBe\fP or \fBS\fP it is a hostname. An empty key parameter
might be used to define a default value that is not host specific. 
The key of \fBl_hard\fP or \fBl_soft\fP has to refer to a resource name 
(name of a complex entry) whereas \fBq_hard\fP, \fBq_soft\fP and \fBmasterq\fP expect a 
queue name. \fBCMDARG\fP expects a string that should be passed as command line argument,
\fBhold_jid\fP a name or job ID of a job and \fBM\fP a mail address.
.sp 1
All parameter/key combinations expect a value argument. For \fBCMDARG\fP, \fBq_hard\fP, \fBq_soft\fP,
\fBhold_jid\fP, \fBM\fP and \fBrou\fP parameter this value has to be an empty argument. \fBac\fP, \fBv\fP, 
\fBl_hard\fP and \fBl_soft\fP allow also empty values.
.sp 1
Independent of the position within the command line the switches
\fB\-adds\fP, \fB\-mods\fP and \fB\-clears\fP will be evaluated after modifications of all
other switches that will be passed to q submit command or \fIqalter\fP and the sequence in which 
they are applied is the same as specified on the command line.
.sp 1
If the \fB\-adds\fP parameter is used to change a list based job 
parameter that was derived from a job class, then this operation might be 
rejected by the Univa Grid Engine system if within the job class access 
specifiers were used that do not allow to add new elements to the list.
(see \fB\-jc\fP option below or find more information concerning job classes 
and access specifiers in
.M sge_job_class 5 ).
.sp 1
.\"
.IP "\fB\-ar ar_id\fP"
Available for \fIqsub\fP, \fIqalter\fP, \fIqrsh\fP, \fIqsh\fP, or \fIqlogin\fP
only.
.sp 1
Assigns the submitted job to be a part of an existing Advance Reservation. 
The complete list of existing Advance Reservations can be obtained using the
.M qrstat 1
command.
.sp 1
Note that the
\fB\-ar\fP
option adds implicitly the \fB\-w e\fP option if not otherwise requested.
.sp 1
.I Qalter
allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified
parameter will only be in effect after a restart or migration of the
job however.
.sp 1
When this option is used for a job or when a corresponding 
value in \fIqmon\fP is specified then this value will be passed to defined JSV
instances as parameter with the name \fB\aar\fP. 
(see \fB\-jsv\fP option below or find more information concerning JSV in
.M jsv 1 )

.IP "\fB\-A account_string\fP"
Available for \fIqsub\fP, \fIqsh\fP, \fIqrsh\fP, \fIqlogin\fP and
\fIqalter\fP only.
.sp 1
Identifies the account to which the resource consumption of the job
should be charged. The \fBaccount_string\fP should conform to the \fBname\fP
definition in
.M sge_types 1 .
In the absence of this parameter Univa Grid Engine 
will place the default account string "sge" in the accounting record
of the job.
.sp 1
.I Qalter
allows changing this option even while the job executes.
.sp 1
If this option or a corresponding value in \fIqmon\fP is specified 
then this value will be passed to defined JSV
instances as parameter with the name \fBA\fP.
(see \fB\-jsv\fP option below or find more information concerning JSV in
.M jsv 1 )
.
.\"
.IP "\fB\-bgio bgio_params\fP"
This option will bypass the problem that the controlling terminal will suspend the
qrsh process when it is reading from STDIN or writing to STDOUT/STDERR file descriptors.

Available for \fIqrsh\fP with builtin interactive job support mechanism only.
.sp 1
Supported if e.g. "&" is used to start the qrsh in the background of a terminal. The terminal
must support job control and must also have a supported tty assigned.
.sp 1
Supported bgio_params options are \fBnr\fP (no read), \fBfw\fP (forced write) and
\fBbw=<size>\fP (buffered write up to the specified buffer size). The combination of the options
is supported by using the "," character as delimiter (no spaces allowed):
.sp 1
bgio_params             nr|bw=<size>|fw[,nr|bw=<size>|fw,...]
.sp 1
.nf
\fBnr\fP: no read
.fi
If the user terminal supports job control the qrsh will not read from STDIN when it is running in background.
If a user is entering some input in the terminal the default behavior often is that the process running
in the background is suspended when it reads the user input from STDIN. This is done by the user's terminal
for all background jobs which try to read from STDIN. By using the "nr" option the qrsh will not read from
STDIN as long it is running in the background.
.sp 1
.nf
\fBfw\fP: force write
.fi
If the "stty tostop" option is active for the user's terminal any job running in the background of the terminal
will be suspended when it tries to write to STDOUT or STDERR. The "fw" option is used to tell qrsh to ignore
this setting and force writing without being suspended.
.sp 1
.nf
\fBbw=<size>\fP: buffered write
.fi
If the user terminal has the "stty tostop" option set (background jobs will be suspended when writing to STDOUT
or STDERR) it is possible to simply buffer the messages in the qrsh client to avoid being suspended by using
this option. The qrsh will write to STDOUT or STDERR if one of the following items occur:
.sp 1
.nf
   - When the process is in foreground again
   - When the buffer is full
   - When the qrsh is terminating
.fi
.sp 1

.\"
.IP "\fB\-binding [ binding_instance ] binding_strategy\fP"
A job can request a specific processor core binding (processor affinity)
with this parameter. This request is treated since version 8.1 as a hard
resource request, i.e. the job is only dispatched to an host which is
able to fulfill the request. In contrast to previous versions the request
is now processed in the Univa Grid Engine scheduler component.
.sp
To enforce Univa Grid Engine to select a specific hardware architecture
please use the \fB-l\fP switch in combination with the complex
attribute \fBm_topology\fP.
.sp
\fBbinding_instance\fP is an optional parameter. It might either be
\fBenv\fP, \fBpe\fP or \fBset\fP depending on which instance should accomplish the
job to core binding. If the value for \fBbinding_instance\fP is
not specified then \fBset\fP will be used.
.sp
\fBenv\fP means that only the environment variable \fBSGE_BINDING\fP will be
exported to the job environment of the job. This variable contains the
selected operating system internal processor numbers.
They might be more than selected cores in presence of SMT or CMT
because each core could be represented by multiple processor identifiers.
The processor numbers are space separated. This variable is also available
in case of real core binding when \fBset\fP or \fBpe\fP was requested.
.sp
\fBpe\fP means that the information about the selected cores appears in
the fourth column of the \fBpe_hostfile\fP. Here the logical core and socket
numbers are printed (they start at 0 and have no holes) in colon separated
pairs (i.e. 0,0:1,0 which means core 0 on socket 0 and core 0 on socket 1).
For more information about the $pe_hostfile check
.M sge_pe 5
.sp
\fBset\fP (default if nothing else is specified). The binding strategy is
applied by Univa Grid Engine. How this is achieved depends on the underlying
operating system of the execution host where the submitted job
will be started.
.sp
On Solaris 10 hosts a processor set will be created
where the job can exclusively run in.
Because of operating system limitations at least one core
must remain unbound. This resource could of course
used by an unbound job.
.sp
On Linux (lx-amd64 or lx-x86) hosts a processor affinity mask will be set to
restrict the job to run exclusively on the selected cores.
The operating system allows other unbound processes
to use these cores.
Please note that on Linux the binding requires a Linux kernel
version of 2.6.16 or greater. It might be even possible to use
a kernel with lower version number but in that case additional
kernel patches have to be applied. The \fBloadcheck\fP tool in the
utilbin directory can be used to check if the hosts capabilities.
You can also use the \fB-sep\fP in combination with \fB-cb\fP of
.M qconf 5
command to identify if Univa Grid Engine is able to recognize the
hardware topology.
.sp
Possible values for \fBbinding_strategy\fP are as follows:
.sp
.nf
.ta \w''u
    linear:<amount>[:<socket>,<core>]
    striding:<amount>:<n>[:<socket>,<core>]
    explicit:[<socket>,<core>;...]<socket>,<core>
.fi
.sp
For the binding strategy linear and striding there is an optional
socket and core pair attached. These denotes the mandatory
starting point for the first core to bind on.
.sp
\fBlinear\fP means that Univa Grid Engine tries to bind the job on \fBamount\fP
successive cores. If \fBsocket\fP and \fBcore\fP is omitted then Univa Grid Engine
first allocates successive cores on the first empty socket found.
Empty means that there are no jobs bound to the socket by Univa Grid Engine.
If this is not  possible or is not sufficient Univa Grid Engine tries to find
(further) cores on the socket with the most unbound cores and so on.
If the amount of allocated cores is lower than requested cores, no
binding is done for the job. If \fBsocket\fP and \fBcore\fP is specified
then Univa Grid Engine tries to find amount of empty cores beginning with this
starting point. If this is not possible then binding is not done.
.sp
In order to force a job to be scheduled to at most one socket a special
complex value needs to be requested together with the \fBlinear\fP 
request. Please note that if there is no host, which offers at least
the requested amount of cores per socket, the job is never going to be
scheduled. For such jobs always the socket with the highest number of free
cores per socket is used. The special complex needs to be created in the
complex configuration and needs to have the name: \fBsched_binding_per_socket\fP
The configuration of the complex is meaningless for this feature, i.e.
it can be freely adapted. Please also note that the complex needs to 
be initialized in order to be usable, either on global, host local, 
or on queue level in the \fBcomplex_values\fP field.
.sp
\fBstriding\fP means that Univa Grid Engine tries to find cores with a certain offset.
It will select \fBamount\fP of empty cores with a offset of \fBn\fP -1 cores
in between. Start point for the search algorithm is socket 0 core 0. As soon as
\fBamount\fP cores are found they will be used to do the job binding.
If there are not enough empty cores or if correct offset cannot
be achieved then there will be no binding done.
.sp
\fBexplicit\fP binds the specified sockets and cores that are mentioned in the
provided socket/core list. Each socket/core pair has to be specified only once. If a
socket/core pair is already in use by a different job the whole binding request
will be ignored.
.sp
\fBQalter\fP allows changing this option even while the job executes. The
modified parameter will only be in effect after a restart or migration
of the job, however.
.sp
If this option or a corresponding value in qmon is specified then these
values will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameters with the names
\fBbinding_strategy\fP, \fBbinding_type\fP, \fBbinding_amount\fP,
\fBbinding_step\fP, \fBbinding_socket\fP, \fBbinding_core\fP,
\fBbinding_exp_n\fP, \fBbinding_exp_socket<id>\fP, \fBbinding_exp_core<id>\fP.
.sp
Please note that the length of the socket/core value list of the explicit
binding is reported as \fBbinding_exp_n\fP. \fB<id>\fP will be replaced
by the position of the socket/core pair within the explicit list (0 <= \fBid\fP < \fBbinding_exp_n\fP).
The first socket/core pair of the explicit binding will be reported
with the parameter names \fBbinding_exp_socket0\fP
and binding_exp_core0.
.sp
Following values are possible for \fBbinding_strategy\fP: \fBlinear_automatic\fP, 
\fBlinear\fP, \fBstriding\fP, \fBstriding_automatic\fP, and \fBexplicit\fP.
The value \fBlinear_automatic\fP corresponds to the command line request -binding linear:<N>.
Hence \fBbinding_amount\fP must be set to the amount of requested cores.
The value \fBlinear\fP corresponds to the command line request "-binding linear:<N>:<socket>,<core>".
Additionally to the \fBbinding_amount\fP the start socket (\fBbinding_socket\fP) and
start core (\fBbinding_core\fP) must be set. Otherwise the request is treated as
"-binding linear:<N>:0,0" which is different to "-binding linear:<N>".
The same rules apply to \fBstriding_automatic\fP and \fBstriding\fP. In the automatic
case the scheduler seeks free cores itself while in non-automatic case the scheduler
starts to fill up cores at the position given with \fBbinding_socket\fP and 
\fBbinding_core\fP if possible (otherwise it skips the host).
.sp
Values that do not apply for the specified binding will not be reported to JSV.
E.g. \fBbinding_step\fP will only be reported for the striding binding and all
\fBbinding_exp_*\fP values will passed to JSV if explicit binding was specified.

.IP "\fB\-b y[es]|n[o]\fP"
Available for \fIqsub\fP, \fIqrsh\fP only. Univa Grid Engine
also supports the modification with \fIqalter\fP.
.sp 1
Gives the user the possibility to indicate explicitly whether
\fBcommand\fP should be treated as binary or script. If the value

The \fBcommand\fP might not be accessible from the submission host.
Nothing except the path of the \fBcommand\fP will be transferred
from the submission host to the execution host. Path aliasing will
be applied to the path of \fBcommand\fP before \fBcommand\fP will
be executed.
.sp 1
If the value of \fB\-b\fP is 'n' then \fBcommand\fP needs to be a
script and it will be handled as script. The script file has to be
accessible by the submission host. It will be transferred to the
execution host. \fIqsub\fP/\fIqrsh\fP will search directive prefixes
within script.
.sp 1
\fIqsub\fP will implicitly use \fB-b n\fP whereas \fIqrsh\fP will apply
the \fB-b y\fP option if nothing else is specified.
.sp 1
\fIQalter\fP
can only be used to change the job type from binary to script when
a script is specified additionally with \fI-CMDNAME\fP.
.sp 1
Please note that submission of \fBcommand\fP as script (\fB\-b n\fP) can have a significant
performance impact, especially for short running jobs and big job scripts.
Script submission adds a number of operations to the submission process:
The job script needs to be
.sp 1
.nf
   - parsed at client side (for special comments)
   - transferred from submit client to qmaster
   - spooled in qmaster
   - transferred to execd at job execution
   - spooled in execd
   - removed from spooling both in execd and qmaster once the job is done
.fi
.sp 1
If job scripts are available on the execution nodes, e.g. via NFS, binary 
submission can be the better choice.
.sp 1
The value specified with this option or the corresponding value specified in
\fIqmon\fP will only be passed to defined JSV instances if the value is \fIyes\fP.
The name of the parameter will be \fBb\fP. The value will be \fBy\fP also

.IP "\fB\-c occasion_specifier\fP"
Available for \fIqsub\fP and \fIqalter\fP only.
.sp 1
Defines or redefines whether the job should be checkpointed, and if so,
under what circumstances. The specification of the checkpointing occasions
with this option overwrites the definitions of the \fIwhen\fP parameter in
the checkpointing environment (see

n	no checkpoint is performed.
s	checkpoint when batch server is shut down.
m	checkpoint at minimum CPU interval.
x	checkpoint when job gets suspended.
<interval>	checkpoint in the specified time interval.
.fi
.sp 1
The minimum CPU interval is defined in the queue configuration (see
.M queue_conf 5
for details).
<interval> has to be specified in the format hh:mm:ss.
The maximum of <interval> and the queue's minimum CPU
interval is used if <interval> is specified. This is done to ensure
that a machine is not overloaded by checkpoints being generated too
frequently.
.sp 1

.IP "\fB\-clearp parameter\fP"
Available for \fIqsub\fP, \fIqrsh\fP and \fIqalter\fP of Univa Grid Engine only.
.sp 1
Gives the user the possibility to clear list bases and non-list based job parameters.
As result the specified job parameter will be reset to the same default value that 
would also be used when a job is submitted with the \fIqsub\fP command without an
additional specification of \fBparameter\fP (e.g \fB\-clearp N\fP would reset the job
name to the default name. For script based jobs this is the basename of the command
script).
.sp 1
If a job is derived from a job class and if the access specifiers that is defined
before (or within a list based attribute) does not allow to delete the parameter

Execute the job from the current working directory.
This switch will activate Univa Grid Engine's path aliasing facility, if the
corresponding

.sp 1
In the case of \fIqalter\fP, the previous definition of the current working

different directory than the preceding \fIqsub\fP or \fIqalter\fP.
.sp 1
.I Qalter
allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified

however.
.sp 1
If this option or a corresponding value in \fIqmon\fP is specified  
then this value will be passed 
to defined JSV instances as parameter with the name \fBcwd\fP. The value of this parameter
will be the absolute path to the working directory. JSV scripts can
remove the path from jobs during the verification process by setting the 
value of this parameter to an empty string. As a result the job
behaves as if \fB-cwd\fP was not specified during job submission.

.\"
.IP "\fB\-C prefix_string\fP"
Available for \fIqsub\fP and \fIqrsh\fP with script submission (\fB-b n\fP).
.sp 1
.I Prefix_string
defines the prefix that declares a directive in the
job's command. The prefix is not a job attribute, but
affects the behavior of \fIqsub\fP and \fIqrsh\fP. If \fBprefix\fP is a
null string, the command will not be scanned for embedded directives.
.br
The directive prefix consists of two ASCII characters which,
when appearing in the first two bytes of a script line,
indicate that what follows is an Univa Grid Engine command.
The default is "#$".
.br
The user should be aware that changing the first delimiting character can
produce unforeseen side effects. If the script file contains anything
other than a "#" character in the first byte position of the line, the shell
processor for the job will reject the line and may exit the job
prematurely.
.br
If the -C option is present in the script file, it is ignored.

.IP "\fB\-dc variable,...\fP"
Available for \fIqsub\fP, \fIqsh\fP, \fIqrsh\fP, \fIqlogin\fP and

.sp 1
Specifies the deadline initiation time in [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS] format (see

.IP "\fB\-e [[hostname]:]path,...\fP"
Available for \fIqsub\fP, \fIqsh\fP, \fIqrsh\fP, \fIqlogin\fP and
\fIqalter\fP only.
.sp 1
Defines or redefines
the path used for the standard error stream of the job. For
\fIqsh\fP, \fIqrsh\fP and \fIqlogin\fP only the standard error
stream of prolog and epilog is redirected.
If the \fBpath\fP constitutes an absolute path name, the
error-path attribute of the job is set to \fBpath\fP, including
the \fBhostname\fP. If the path name is relative, Univa Grid Engine
expands \fBpath\fP either with the current working directory
path (if the \fB\-cwd\fP switch (see above) is also
specified) or with the home directory path. If 
\fBhostname\fP is present, the standard error stream will be
placed in the corresponding location only if the job runs on
the specified host. If the path contains a ":" without a
\fBhostname\fP, a leading ":" has to be specified.
.sp 1
By default the file name for interactive jobs is \fI/dev/null\fP. For
batch jobs the default file name has the form \fIjob_name.\fPe\fIjob_id\fP and
\fIjob_name.\fPe\fIjob_id\fP.\fBtask_id\fP for array job tasks (see
\fB\-t\fP option below).
.sp 1
If \fBpath\fP is a directory, the standard error stream of the
job will be put in this directory under the default file name.
If the pathname contains certain pseudo environment variables,
their value will be expanded at runtime of the job and will be used
to constitute the standard error stream path name. The following
pseudo environment variables are supported currently:
.sp 1
.nf
.ta \w'$JOB_NAME   'u
$HOME	home directory on execution machine
$USER	user ID of job owner
$JOB_ID	current job ID
$JOB_NAME	current job name (see \fB\-N\fP option)
$HOSTNAME	name of the execution host
$TASK_ID	array job task index number
.fi
.sp 1
Alternatively to $HOME the tilde sign "~" can be used as common in
.M csh 1
or
.M ksh 1 .
Note, that the "~" sign also works in combination with user names,
so that "~<user>" expands to the home directory of <user>. Using
another user ID than that of the job owner
requires corresponding permissions, of course.
.sp 1
If \fBpath\fP or any component of it does not exist, it will be
created with the permissions of the current user.
A trailing "/" indicates that the last component of  \fBpath\fP is a directory.
For example the command "qsub -e myjob/error.e $SGE_ROOT/examples/sleeper.sh"
will create the directory "myjob" in the current working directory if it does
not exist, and write the standard error stream of the job into the 
file "error.e". The command "qsub -e myotherjob/ $SGE_ROOT/examples/sleeper.sh" 
will create the directory "myotherjob", and write the standard
error stream of the job into a file with the default name (see 
description above). If it is not possible to create the directory 
(e.g. insufficient permissions), the job will be put in error state.
.sp 1
.I Qalter
allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified
parameter will only be in effect after a restart or migration of the job,
however.

.sp 1
Signifies that all \fB\-q\fP and \fB\-l\fP resource requirements following in the
command line will be hard requirements and must be satisfied
in full before a job can be scheduled.
.br
As Univa Grid Engine scans the command line and script file for Univa Grid Engine
options and parameters it builds a list of resources required
by a job. All such resource requests are considered as
absolutely essential for the job to commence. If the
\fB\-soft\fP option (see below) is encountered during the scan
then all following resources are designated as "soft
requirements" for execution, or "nice-to-have, but not
essential". If the \fB\-hard\fP flag is encountered at a later
stage of the scan, all resource requests following it once
again become "essential". The \fB\-hard\fP and \fB\-soft\fP
options in effect act as "toggles" during the scan.
.sp 1
If this option or a corresponding value in \fIqmon\fP is specified then

a job class. \fBjc_name\fP might either be a name of a job class or the
combination of a job class name and a variant name, both 
names separated by a dot (.).
.sp 1
If this switch is used then within the 
.M sge_qmaster 8
process following 6 steps will be executed:
.sp 1
\fB(1)\fP A new job will be created
.sp 1
\fB(2)\fP This job structure will be initialized with default values.
.sp 1
\fB(3)\fP Then all those default values will be replaced with that values that
are specified as job template attributes in the job class (or job 
class variant).
.sp 1
\fB(4)\fP If the \fB\-jc\fP switch was combined with other command line 
switches that specify job characteristics then those settings will be applied
to the job. This step might overwrite default values and values that
where copied from the job class specification.
.sp 1
\fB(5)\fP Server JSV will be triggered if configured. This server JSV script 
will receive the specification of the job and if the server JSV adjusts the job 
specification then default values, values derived from the job class
specification and values specified at the command line might be 
overwritten.
.sp 1
\fB(6)\fP With the last step sge_qmaster checks if any access specifiers
were violated during the steps (4) or (5). If this is the case then
the job is rejected. Otherwise it will enter the list of pending jobs.
.sp 1
The server JSV that might be triggered with step (5) will receive
the \fB\jc_name\fP as a parameter with the name \fB\jc\fP. If a server JSV
decides to change the \fB\jc\fP attribute then the process described above will restart at step (1) and the new \fB\jc_name\fP will be used for step (3).
.sp 1
Please note that the violation of the access specifiers is checked in the 
last step. As result a server JSV is also not allowed to apply modifications 
to the job that would violate any access specifiers defined in the job class 
specification.
.sp 1
Any attempt to change a job attribute of a job that was derived from a 
job class will be rejected. Owners of the job class can soften this 
restriction by using access specifiers within the specification of a 
job class. Details concerning access specifiers can be found in 
.M sge_job_class 5.
.sp 1
The qalter -jc NONE command can be used by managers to release the
link between a submitted job class job and its parent job class. In this case
all other job parameters won't be changed but it will be possible
to change all settings with qalter afterwards independent on the access
specifiers that were used.

.IP "\fB\-js job_share\fP"
Available for \fIqsub\fP, \fIqsh\fP, \fIqrsh\fP, \fIqlogin\fP and
\fIqalter\fP only.
.sp 1
Defines or redefines the job share of the job relative to other jobs.
Job share is an unsigned integer value.
The default job share value for jobs is 0.
.sp 1
The job share influences the Share Tree Policy and the Functional
Policy. It has no effect on the Urgency and Override Policies (see
.M share_tree 5 ,
.M sched_conf 5
and the
.I "Univa Grid Engine Installation and Administration Guide"
for further information on the resource management policies supported by Univa Grid Engine).
.sp 1
In case of the Share Tree Policy, users can distribute the tickets to
which they are currently entitled among their jobs using different
shares assigned via \fB\-js\fP. If all jobs have the same job share
value, the tickets are distributed evenly. Otherwise, jobs receive tickets
relative to the different job shares. Job shares are treated like
an additional level in the share tree in the latter case.
.sp 1
In connection with the Functional Policy, the job share can be used to
weight jobs within the functional job category.
Tickets are distributed relative to any
uneven job share distribution treated as a virtual share distribution level
underneath the functional job category.
.sp 1
If both the Share Tree and the Functional Policy are active, the job
shares will have an effect in both policies, and the tickets
independently derived in each of them are added to the total number of
tickets for each job.
.sp 1
If this option or a corresponding value in \fIqmon\fP is specified then
this value will be passed to defined JSV
instances as parameter with the name \fBjs\fP.

Available for \fIqsub\fP, \fIqrsh\fP, and \fIqalter\fP. Supported on lx-amd64
execution hosts only (for more details try \fButilbin/loadcheck \-cb\fP on the execution
host).
.sp 1
Sets the memory allocation strategy for all processes and sub-processes of a job.
On execution hosts with a NUMA architecture, the memory access latency and memory
throughput depends on which NUMA node the memory is allocated and on which socket/core
the job runs. In order to influence the memory allocation different submit options are
provided:
.sp 1
\fB-mbind cores\fP Prefers memory on the NUMA node where the job is bound with core binding.
Requires core binding set with -binding. The optional "m_mem_free" request is
enhanced during scheduling time with implicit per NUMA node requests ("m_mem_free_n<node>"),
depending on which cores the job is bound to. For more details see \fB\-mbind cores:strict\fP
.sp 1
\fB-mbind cores:strict\fP The job is only allowed to allocate memory on the NUMA node where
it is bound to. Requires core binding set with -binding. The optional "m_mem_free"
request is extended during scheduling time by implicit per NUMA node requests
("m_mem_free_n<node>"), depending on which cores the job is bound to. The amount of
selected cores per NUMA node and the total memory per slot request determining
the amount of required memory per NUMA node. Hence when using the "m_mem_free"
memory request the job is only scheduled to sockets which offer the specific amount
of free memory.
.sp 1
\fB-mbind round_robin\fP Sets the memory allocation strategy for the job to interleaved
memory access. When the memory resource request "m_mem_free" is used, the scheduler
also adds implicit memory requests for all NUMA nodes on the execution host
("m_mem_free_n<node>").
.sp 1
\fB-mbind nlocal\fP Only allowed for serial jobs or jobs using a parallel environment with
allocation rule "$pe_slots". Unspecified behavior for other PEs. Automatically binds a
sequential or multi-threaded job to cores or sockets and sets an appropriate memory allocation
strategy. Requires a resource request for the "m_mem_free" host complex. The behavior of
the scheduler depends on the execution hosts characteristics as well whether the job is a serial
job or a multi-threaded parallel job (PE job with allocation rule "$pe_slots"). It is
not allowed to override the implicit core binding with the \fB\-binding\fP switch.
.sp 1
The scheduler algorithm for sequential jobs is as follows:
.br
- If the host can't fulfill the "m_mem_free" request then the host is skipped.
.br
- If the job requests more ram than free on each socket but less than
installed on the sockets the host is skipped.
.br
- If memory request is "smaller" than amount of free memory on a socket,
try to bind the job to "one core on the socket" and decrements the amount
of memory on this socket ("m_mem_free_n<nodenumber>"). The global host memory
"m_mem_free" on this host is decremented as well.
.br
- If memory request is "greater" than the amount of free memory on any socket,
find an unbound socket and bind it there completely and allow memory overflow.
Decrement from "m_mem_free" as well as from "m_mem_free_n<socketnumber>" and the
remaining memory round robin from the remaining sockets.
.br
- If both are not possible go to the next host.
.sp 1
The scheduler algorithm for parallel jobs is as follows:
.br
- Hosts that don't offer "m_mem_free" memory are skipped (of course hosts that doesn't offer the amount
of free slots requested are skipped as well).
.br
- If the amount of requested slots is greater than the amount of cores per socket, the job is
dispatched to the host without any binding.
.br
- If the amount of requested slots is smaller than the amount of cores per socket do following:
.br
- If there is any socket which offers enough memory ("m_mem_free_n<N>") and enough free cores bind
the job to these cores and set memory allocation mode to "cores:strict" (so that only local memory
requests can be done by the job).
.br
- If this is not possible try to find a socket which is completely unbound and has more than the
required amount of memory installed ("m_mem_total_n<N>"). Bind the job to the complete socket,
decrement the memory on that socket at "m_mem_free_n<N>" (as well as host globally on "m_mem_free")
and set the memory allocation strategy to "cores" (preferred usage of socket local memory).
.sp 1
If the parameters are requesting the "m_mem_free" complex, the resulting NUMA
node memory requests can be seen in the "implicit_requests" row in the qstat
output.
.sp 1
Note that resource reservation for implicit per NUMA node requests as well as topology
selections for core binding are not part of resource reservation yet.
.sp 1
The value specified with the \fB\-mbind\fP option will be passed to defined JSV
instances (as "mbind") only when set. JSV can set the parameter as "round_robin", "cores",
"cores:strict", or "NONE". The same values can be used for job classes. 
.\"
.IP "\fB\-notify\fP"
Available for \fIqsub\fP, \fIqrsh\fP (with command) and
\fIqalter\fP only.
.sp 1
This flag,
when set causes Univa Grid Engine to send "warning" signals
to a running job prior to sending the signals themselves. If
a SIGSTOP is pending, the job will receive a SIGUSR1 several
seconds before the SIGSTOP. If a SIGKILL is pending, the job
will receive a SIGUSR2 several seconds before the SIGKILL.
This option provides the running job, before receiving the SIGSTOP 
or SIGKILL, a configured time interval to do e.g. cleanup operations.  
The amount of time delay is controlled by the \fBnotify\fP
parameter in each queue configuration (see
.M queue_conf 5 ).
.sp 1
Note that the Linux operating system "misused" the user signals SIGUSR1
and SIGUSR2 in some early Posix thread implementations. You might not want
to use the \fB\-notify\fP option if you are running multi-threaded applications
in your jobs under Linux, particularly on 2.0 or earlier kernels.

No command shell will be executed for the job.  This option only applies when
\fB\-b y\fP is also used.  Without \fB\-b y\fP, \fB\-shell n\fP has no effect.
.sp 1
This option can be used to speed up execution as some overhead, like the  
shell startup and sourcing the shell resource files is avoided.

This option can only be used if no shell-specific command line parsing is
required. If the command line contains shell syntax, like environment
variable substitution or (back) quoting, a shell must be started.
In this case either do not use the \fB\-shell n\fP option or execute the shell

It is possible to specify ranges for consumable resource requirements if
they are declared as \fB\-soft\fP  requests. More information
about soft ranges can be found in the description of the \fB\-l\fP option.
.sp 1
As Univa Grid Engine scans the command line and script file for Univa Grid Engine
options and parameters, it builds a list of resources required
by the job. All such resource requests are considered as
absolutely essential for the job to commence. If the
\fB\-soft\fP option is encountered during the scan
then all following resources are designated as "soft
requirements" for execution, or "nice-to-have, but not
essential". If the \fB\-hard\fP flag (see above) is encountered at a later
stage of the scan, all resource requests following it once
again become "essential". The \fB\-hard\fP and \fB\-soft\fP

.sp 1
The task id range specified in the option argument
may be a single number, a simple range of the form
n-m or a range with a step size. Hence, the task id range specified by
2-10:2 would result in the task id indexes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10,
for a total of 5 identical tasks, each with the environment variable
SGE_TASK_ID containing one of the 5 index numbers.
.sp 1
All array job tasks inherit the same resource requests and attribute
definitions as specified in the \fIqsub\fP or \fIqalter\fP command line,
except for the \fB\-t\fP option. The tasks are scheduled independently and,
provided enough resources exist, concurrently, very much like separate jobs.
However, an array job or a sub-array there of can be accessed as a single unit
by commands like
.M qmod 1
or
.M qdel 1 .
See the corresponding manual pages for further detail.

Array jobs are commonly used to execute the same type of operation on
varying input data sets correlated with the task index number. The number
