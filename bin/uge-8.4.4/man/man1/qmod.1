.TH QMOD 1 "UGE 8.4.4" "Univa Grid Engine User Commands"
.SH NAME
qmod \- modify a Univa Grid Engine queue, running job or job class
.\"
.SH SYNTAX
.B qmod
[
.B options
] 
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIQmod\fP enabled users classified as owners of a running job, queue or 
job class to modify the state of that object. Users that have submitted
a job automatically own the job. Queue and job class ownership is defined 
by the \fIowner\fP attribute within a queue and by the \fIowner_list\fP 
attribute defined in the job class (see
.M queue_conf 5
or
.M sge_job_class 5
for details). 
.PP
A manager/operator or root can execute \fIqmod\fP for any object in a 
Univa Grid Engine but only from administrative hosts.
.PP
The switches below expect the arguments \fIwc_queue_list\fP,
\fIwc_job_list\fP or \fIjc_list\fP that describe the object that should
be modified. Find the description for these arguments in
.M sge_types 1 .

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-c wc_job_range_list | wc_queue_list\fP"
.B Note:
Deprecated, may be removed in future release. Please use the \fB\-cj\fP 
or \fB\-cq\fP switch instead. 
.sp 1
Clears the error state of the specified jobs(s)/queue(s).
.\"
.\"
.IP "\fB\-cj wc_job_range_list\fP"
Clears the error state of the specified jobs(s).
.\"
.\"
.IP "\fB\-cq wc_queue_list\fP"
Clears the error state of the specified queue(s).
.\"
.\"
.IP "\fB\-d wc_queue_list\fP"
Disables the queue(s), i.e. no further jobs are dispatched to
disabled queues while jobs already executing in these queues
are allowed to finish.
.\"
.\"
.IP "\fB\-djc jc_list\fP"
Disables the job class variant(s) that are specified. If only the
job class name is specified (without variant name) then only the 
default variant of a job class will be disabled whereas all other 
variants remain in their previous state. Job class variants that 
are in the disabled state cannot be used to create new jobs.
.\"
.\"
.IP "\fB\-e wc_queue_list\fP"
Enables the queue(s).
.\"
.\"
.IP "\fB\-E wc_queue_list\fP"
Sets queue(s) into error state.
.\"
.\"
.IP "\fB\-ejc jc_list\fP"
Enables the job class variant(s) that are specified. 
If only the job class name is specified (without variant name) then
only the default variant of a job class will be disabled 
whereas all other variants remain in their previous state. Job class 
variants that are in enabled state can be used to create new jobs.
.\"
.\"
.IP "\fB\-f\fP"
Force the modification action for the queue despite the apparent current 
state of the queue. For example if a queue appears to be suspended but 
the job execution seems to be continuing the manager/operator can force 
a suspend operation which will send a SIGSTOP to the jobs. In any case, 
the queue or job status will be set even if the
.M sge_execd 8
controlling the queues/jobs cannot be reached. Requires manager/operator 
privileges.
.\"
.\"
.IP "\fB\-help\fP"
Prints a listing of all options.
.\"
.\"
.IP "\fB\-msg [message]\fP"
The \fB\-msg\fP switch can be used in combination with other switches of
this command that trigger queue state changes. The specified message will be
attached to specified queues. If message is omitted then previously 
attached messages will be deleted. The message string will be
displayed by qstat if the \fB\-explain m\fP switch is specified for this command.
.\"
.\"
.IP "\fB\-p jid wc_job_task_list [preemptive_action]\fP"
Sends a manual preemption request to the Univa Grid Engine system. 

The job specified by \fIjid\fP has to be pending and it will be seen
as preemptor candidate by the Univa Grid Engine system. All other jobs (or tasks of an array job)
specified by \fIwc_job_task_list\fP have to be running and they act as
preemptee candidates.

The Univa Grid Engine scheduler tries to start the preemptor candidate if there are no other
jobs with a higher effective priority. If there are no free resources available
then the system will preempt the preemptee candidates to gain access to the used 
resources so that the preemptor candidate can be started. 

The method how preemptee candidates are preempted can be specified by the
\fIpreemption_action\fP. It can be one of the letters (\fBS\fP)suspend, e(\fBN\fP)handed suspend,
(\fBP\fP)reempt, (\fBC\fP)heckpoint, (\fBR\fP)erun or (\fBT\fP)erminate. If the specified preemption 
action is not available for a preemptee candidate or when the \fIpreemption_action\fP
is not specified then the system might choose an appropriate preemption action
to gain required resources.

For more detail about preemption and the differences of the preemptive actions

.IP "\fB\-r wc_job_range_list | wc_queue_list\fP"
\fBNote:\fP Deprecated, may be removed in future release. Please use 
the \fB\-rj\fP or \fB\-rq\fP switch instead.
.sp 1
If applied to queues, reschedules all jobs currently running in this queue.
If applied to running jobs, reschedules the jobs. Requires root or 
manager privileges. In order for a job to be rescheduled, it or the queue in
which it is executing must have the rerun flag activated. (See \fI-r\fP 
option in the
.M qsub 1
man page and the \fIrerun\fP option in the
.M queue_conf 5
man page for more information.)
.sp 1
Additional restrictions apply for parallel and checkpointing jobs. (See the
\fIreschedule_unknown\fP description in the
.M sge_conf 5
man page for details).
.\"
.\"
.IP "\fB\-rj wc_job_range_list\fP"
If applied to running jobs, reschedules the jobs if they can be rescheduled.
See also the \fB\-r\fP switch. Requires root or manager privileges.
.\"
.\"
.IP "\fB\-rq wc_queue_list\fP"
If applied to queues, reschedules all jobs currently running in this queue.
For parallel jobs, the job is rescheduled only if the master task of this
parallel job is running in this queue.
See also the \fB\-r\fP switch. Requires root or manager privileges.
.\"
.\"
.IP "\fB\-s wc_job_range_list | wc_queue_list\fP"
.B Note:
Deprecated, may be removed in future release.
Please use the \fB\-sj\fP or \fB\-sq\fP switch instead.
.sp 1
If applied to queues, suspends the queues and any jobs which might be active.
If applied to running jobs, suspends the jobs.
.\"
.\"
.IP "\fB\-si session_id\fP"
Requests sent by this client to the 
.M sge_qmaster 1 
daemon will be done as part of the specified session. If the switch is
omitted or if \fBNONE\fP is specified as \fBsession_id\fP then such
requests will be executed outside the control of a session.
.sp 1

.M session_conf 5 .
.\"
.\"
.IP "\fB\-sj wc_job_range_list\fP"
If applied to running jobs, suspends the jobs. For parallel jobs, Univa Grid
Engine sends the STOP signal to the master task only. The master task has
to handle the suspending of all slave tasks itself then. This is because
Univa Grid Engine doesn't know in which order the slave tasks have to be
suspended.
If a job is both suspended explicitly and via suspension of its queue, a
following unsuspend of the queue will not release the suspension
state on the job.
.\"
.\"
.IP "\fB\-sq wc_queue_list\fP"
If applied to queues, suspends the queues and any jobs which might be active.
For parallel jobs, Univa Grid Engine sends the STOP signal to the master task
only (see \fB\-sj\fP switch). If any slave task of a parallel job runs in a
queue that is to be suspended, the master task of this job is suspended, no
matter where it is running.
.\"
.\"
.IP "\fB\-us wc_job_range_list | wc_queue_list\fP"
.B Note:
Deprecated, may be removed in future release.
Please use the \fB\-usj\fP or \fB\-usq\fP switch instead.
.sp 1
If applied to queues, unsuspends the queues and any jobs which might
be active. If applied to jobs, unsuspends the jobs. For parallel jobs, please
see the \fB\-usj\fP or \fB\-usq\fP switch.
.\"
.\"
.IP "\fB\-usj wc_job_range_list\fP"
If applied to jobs, unsuspends the jobs. For parallel jobs, Univa Grid Engine
sends the CONT signal to the master task only. The master task has to handle
the unsuspending of all slave tasks itself then.
If a job is both suspended explicitly and via suspension of its queue, a
following unsuspend of the queue will not release the suspension state on the job.
A parallel job is not un-suspended as long as at least one task of this job is
suspended for any reason.
.\"
.\"
.IP "\fB\-usq wc_queue_list\fP"
If applied to queues, unsuspends the queues and any jobs which might be active.
For parallel jobs, Univa Grid Engine sends the CONT signal to the master task
only (see \fB\-usj\fP\ switch). A parallel job is not unsuspended as long as at
least one task of this job is suspended for any reason.
