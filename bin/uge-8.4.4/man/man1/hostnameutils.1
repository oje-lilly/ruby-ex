.SH DESCRIPTION
.I gethostname
and
.I gethostbyname
are used to get the local resolved host name.
.I gethostbyaddr
is used to get the hostname of a specified IP address (dotted decimal notation).
.I getservbyname
can be used to get the configured port number of a service (e.g. from /etc/services).
.PP
The hostname utils are primarily used by the Univa Grid Engine installation scripts.
.I gethostname
,
.I gethostbyname
and
.I gethostbyaddr
called without any option will print out the hostname, all specified aliases, and the
IP address of the locally resolved hostname.
Calling
.I getservbyname
without any option will print out the full service entry.

.SH OPTIONS
.\"
.SS "\fB\-help\fP"
.PP
Prints a list of all options.
.\"
.SS "\fB\-name\fP"
.PP
This option only reports the primary name of the host.
.SS "\fB\-aname\fP"
.PP
If this option is set, the Univa Grid Engine host alias file is used for host name
resolving. It is necessary to set the environment variable SGE_ROOT and,
if more than one cell is defined, also SGE_CELL.
.PP
This option will print out the Univa Grid Engine host name.
.SS "\fB\-all\fP"
.PP
By using the \fB\-all\fP option all available host information will be printed.
This information includes the host name, the Univa Grid Engine host name, all host aliases, 
and the IP address of the host.
.SS "\fB\-all_rr\fP" (only for gethostbyname)
.PP
The \fB\-all_rr\fP option will enhance the \fB\-all\fP option output. It will in addition
try to contact the sge_qmaster daemon in order to resolve the specified hostname
also on the sge_qmaster host.
.PP
If the daemon is not running or cannot be contacted
the command will print out errors and terminate with an error exit code.
.PP
If the sge_qmaster
host could be contacted successfully the output will include an extra line
showing the resulting hostname on the sge_qmaster host and also the host name
of the sge_qmaster service.
.SS "\fB\-number\fP"
.PP
This option will print out the port number of the specified service name.
.SS "\fB<name>\fP"
.PP
The host name for which the information is requested.
.SS "\fB<ip>\fP"
The IP address (dotted decimal notation) for which the information is requested.
.SS "\fB<service>\fP"
The service name for which the information is requested (e.g. ftp, sge_qmaster or sge_execd).
.\"

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
The following example shows how to get the port number of the FTP service:
.PP
.RS
.nf
>getservbyname -number ftp
21
.fi
.RE
.PP
The next example shows the output of gethostname -all when the host alias file
contains this line:
.PP
gridmaster extern_name extern_name.mydomain
.PP
The local host resolving must also provide the alias name "gridmaster". Each Univa Grid Engine
host that wants to use the cluster must be able to resolve the host name "gridmaster". 
.PP
To setup an alias name, edit your /etc/hosts file or modify your NIS setup to provide the alias for the NIS clients.
.PP
The host alias file must be readable from each host (use e.g. NFS shared file location).
.PP
.RS
.nf
>gethostname -all
Hostname: extern_name.mydomain
SGE name: gridmaster
Aliases:  loghost gridmaster
Host Address(es): 192.168.143.99
