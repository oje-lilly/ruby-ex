.SH NAME
sgepasswd \- Modify the Univa Grid Engine password file

.SH SYNTAX

]

[
.B -D domain

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I sgepasswd
modifies the Univa Grid Engine password file 
.M sgepasswd 5 . 
.PP
This file contains a list of usernames and their windows password in 
encrypted form. 
.M sge_execd 8
and
.M sge_shepherd 8  
on hosts running Microsoft Windows as operating systems use this 
information to start jobs for a certain user. 
.PP
Each user can use the 
.I sgepasswd 
application to add a new entry for the own user account. It is also possible 
to change the stored password with 
.I sgepasswd 
as far as the user knows the old one.
.PP
The root user additionally has the permission to change the password entries 
for other user accounts. Root can also delete existing entries.
.PP
The 
.I sgepasswd
application is only available on non-Windows hosts. In order to be able to modify the
.M sgepasswd 5
file, the
.I sgepasswd
application needs to run with the right user ID set (usually the one of root). To achieve
this, the setuid bit has to be set in the file permissions and the
.I sgepasswd
application has to be owned by the right user (usually root). The
.M sge_qmaster 8
installation script sets the permissions and owner properly if it is requested.

The "ls -l" output of the
.I sgepasswd
application should look like this:

-r-sr-xr-x  1 root root 4136176 Dec 10 15:51 sgepasswd

However, the setuid mechanism does not work if the
.I sgepasswd
application resides on a file system that is mounted with the "nosuid" option. If policies
require the $SGE_ROOT directory to be located on such a file system, copying the
.I sgepasswd
application to a different location is a possible workaround for this problem.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-D domain\fP"
Per default 
.I sgepasswd 
will add/modify the current Unix username without domain specification.

Only root can use this parameter to delete entries from the
.M sgepasswd 5 
file.

.IP "\fB\-help\fP"
Prints a listing of all options.
.\"
.SH "ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES"
.\" 
.IP "\fBSGE_CERTFILE\fP" 1.5i
