.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I uge_js_service.exe cooperates with the
.M sge_execd 8
to run jobs on Windows hosts. It is a Win32 service that is started at boot time
under the "Local System" account, giving it the permissions to give any process the
permissions to access the visible Desktop in order to let jobs display their GUI there.
.br
This service runs independently of the
.M sge_execd 8
(i.e. it is not started and stopped together with the execution daemon) and there
can be only one
.I uge_js_service.exe per host.
.PP
Jobs can request to be allowed to display their GUI on the visible desktop by 
requesting the resource "display_win_gui" (qsub -l display_win_gui=1).
.PP
The Windows administrator can operate this service using the usual Windows
Service Control Manager or the "net" command. The "start" method starts the
service if possible, the "stop" method stops it regardless of any jobs that
might be still running. For a graceful shutdown, first run the "pause" method.
This will start the shutdown procedure of the service and prevent it from
accepting any further jobs. After this, the "resume" (aka "continue") method
will fail as long as there are jobs running in the
.I uge_js_service.exe.
If no job is left in the service, the "resume" method will succeed and the
service will stop.
