.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sge_qmaster
[
.B \-help

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I sge_qmaster
controls the overall Univa Grid Engine behavior in a cluster.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-help\fP"
Prints  a listing of all options.

.SH "ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES"
.\" 
.IP "\fBSGE_ROOT\fP" 1.5i
Specifies the location of the Univa Grid Engine standard configuration
files.
.\"
.IP "\fBSGE_CELL\fP" 1.5i
If set, specifies the default Univa Grid Engine cell. To address a Univa Grid Engine
cell
.I sge_qmaster
uses (in the order of precedence):
.sp 1
.RS
.RS
The name of the cell specified in the environment 
variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.
.sp 1

.IP "\fBSGE_DEBUG_LEVEL\fP" 1.5i
If set, specifies that debug information
should be written to stderr. In addition the level of
detail in which debug information is generated is defined.
.\"
.IP "\fBSGE_QMASTER_PORT\fP" 1.5i
If set, specifies the tcp port on which
.M sge_qmaster 8
is expected to listen for communication requests.
Most installations will use a services map entry for the
service "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.
.\"
.IP "\fBSGE_EXECD_PORT\fP" 1.5i
If set, specifies the tcp port on which
.M sge_execd 8
is expected to listen for communication requests.
Most installations will use a services map entry for the
service "sge_execd" instead to define that port.

.SH RESTRICTIONS
.I sge_qmaster
is usually started from root on the master or shadow master machines of the
cluster (refer to the
.I Univa Grid Engine Installation and Administration Guide
for more information about the configuration of shadow master hosts).
If started by a normal user, a master spool directory must be used to which
the user has read/write access. In this case only jobs being submitted
by that same user are handled correctly by the system.
