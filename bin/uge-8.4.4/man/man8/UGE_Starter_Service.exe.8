Installs the service. Only the local Administrator has the permissions to

to the service by opening the Windows Services dialog and selecting the
"Log on" tab.
.\"
.SS "\fB\-uninstall\fP"
Uninstalls the service. Only the local Administrator has the permissions to
uninstall the service. Only a stopped service can be uninstalled. See the
Windows command net.exe for information on how to stop a service.

Adds an execution daemon to the list of daemons to start at boot time.
